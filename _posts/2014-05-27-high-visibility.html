<h3>Student advocates for people with disabilities</h3>
<p class="intro">Recently, Ania Flatau dropped into a kickboxing
class at Greg Dow&apos;s Fitness Center. What might surprise you is that
Ania uses a wheelchair.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I like to try everything once,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve gained a lot of
health benefits and confidence by being able to move and
dance.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She&#x2019;s also a regular Zumba participant, a
fierce basketball player, and a wheelchair ballroom dancer. And she
explored acroyoga &#x2014; an artform that combines yoga and acrobatics &#x2014;
through CSU Summer Arts. Being visible and participating in
community events are both part of Flatau&#x2019;s lifestyle and connected
to her work as an advocate for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If I can be part of class and change a perspective by being
involved like everyone else, that is seventh heaven,&#x201D; she said.
&#x201C;There are going to be adaptations, but [my classmates can see]
those as a normal way of being.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A kinesiology major, Flatau envisions her career in occupational
therapy. Flatau was born with spina bifida and she likes the idea
of working with people who&#x2019;ve had spinal cord injuries because they
are coming from a different perspective.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have the body I have, and I&#x2019;ve learned how to work with it,&#x201D;
she said. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re going from one life to another. I think we both
would learn a lot from that relationship. But occupational therapy
is a broad field &#x2014; there are a lot of different directions I could
go.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Flatau grew up participating in the athletic community, but she
really stepped up her advocacy work when she joined Yo! Disabled
and Proud, a national organization for disabled youth, just after
high school. She worked with Yo! on a campaign to increase the
number of schools that celebrate Disability History Week.</p>
<p>&#x201C;At the time, I thought I knew everything and was very
independent,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Through Yo!, I learned a lot about myself
and the community. There is a reason we have curb cuts and
elevators -- because somebody fought for us. That became the reason
I do the advocacy work that I do now.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She&#x2019;s continued that advocacy on campus as a member of the
Student Awareness for Disability Empowerment, a student club that
provides educational programs, networking, and awareness in order
to advance the rights of people with disabilities within the c</p></div></div></div>ts of people with disabilities within the campus
community.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s important for injured people and people with
disabilities to be visible,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It is more than just a pity
thing, and it doesn&#x2019;t have to be something you are embarrassed
about. I want to highlight the culture and community.&#x201D;</p>
