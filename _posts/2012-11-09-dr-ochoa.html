<p>Dear friends of Cal State Monterey Bay,</p>
<p>When I first expressed interest to California State University
Chancellor Charles Reed in returning to California from Washington,
D.C., I wasn&#x2019;t necessarily thinking of Cal State Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>However, when the opportunity presented itself to become interim
president of this campus, the more I thought about the idea, the
more excited I got. And nothing that has happened since my wife
Holly and I arrived in Monterey County in July has made me question
that decision.</p>
<p>Serving as assistant secretary for postsecondary education in
the Obama Administration for two years had given me a high-level
look at the challenges facing our colleges and universities &#x2013;
challenges that go to the very core of where our nation, our
economy and our society are heading.<br>
We must increase the rate at which U.S. students earn college
degrees. Our nation has slipped behind many leading industrial
countries in the education level of its citizens. That is not
sustainable if we are to compete in the global marketplace and
educate the next generation of leaders and problem-solvers.</p>
<p>To achieve our goals, we must increase enrollments in the face
of stagnant or declining resources. We also must reach out to
minority populations, particularly Latinos. They will be the
fastest-increasing segment of our population in the coming decades,
but they do not historically have high rates of participation in
higher education.</p>
<p>What university is better prepared to address these challenges
than Cal State Monterey Bay?<br>
Already, our student body is approximately one-third Latino; just
over half of our students are first-generation.</p>
<p>However, this is not just about demographics, it is about
attitude. Cal State Monterey Bay was founded by educators and
community leaders who were dedicated to meeting the educational
needs of our diverse population differently, through such
innovations as an outcomes-based curriculum, service learning, and
capstone experiences. We must build upon that legacy. In doing so,
our university can become a model that others will follow.</p>
<p>In my conversations with faculty, staff and students on campus,
I hope to share ideas and to tap into that creative spirit as we
determine how we can make our university a leader in this new era
of higher education.</p>
<p>This is a great place to be and I am looking forward to the
dialogue, the challenges and the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Eduardo M. Ochoa, Interim President</p>
