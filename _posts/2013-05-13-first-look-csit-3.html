<p>Cal State Monterey Bay and Hartnell College&#xA0;have partnered
to offer a new fast-track to&#xA0;a degree in Computer Science
&amp; Information Technology. Through this accelerated program
students will graduate in just three years and be ready to compete
for in-demand opportunities in the high-tech job market and in
graduate school.</p>
<p>The first 30 students will begin the program this fall and
follow a pre-determined series of courses. For the first year and a
half, they will take classes predominantly at Hartnell, followed by
the second year and&#xA0;a half of coursework at CSUMB. During
their second summer in the program, students will complete paid
internships at organizations such as the Naval Postgraduate School,
Cisco and Microsoft.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve tried to build a well-rounded program,&#x201D; said Sathya
Narayanan, a computer science faculty member at CSUMB. &#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t
simply compressing the course schedule, crossing our fingers, and
hoping students show up to graduate in three years. We&#x2019;ve built an
infrastructure to support the student every step of the way and
expect significant commitment from students to meet the rigorous
demands of this program.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Joe Welch, computer science instructor at Hartnell College,
adds, &#x201C;Along with the infrastructure support, we are also going to
collect extensive data to dem- onstrate the academic quality and
preparedness of a CSIT-in-3 graduate.&#x201D;</p>
<p>CSIT-in-3 is designed as a cohort-based program, meaning
students who start the program together will take all classes,
participate in extra-curricular activities, and graduate together.
Enhanced student services such as progress tracking, priority
registration and tutoring will help students stay on track for the
length of the intensive program. They will also benefit from
workshops, field trips and guest speakers arranged especially for
CSIT-in-3 students.</p>
<p>Maria Rivera, a prospective student, said, &#x201C;I am confident that
spending three years with the same people, studying the same
courses, and pursuing common goals will have a significant impact
on my life. Being in the CSIT-in-3 cohort will provide me with a
support system and sense of community whether it involves studying,
homework, or just life in general. I know that CSIT-in-3 is for
me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The three-year program is designed to keep tuition costs at a
minimum, plus eligible students can apply for generous scholarships
from the Matsui Foundation, which has committed to providing
$40,000 each to 24 eligible students from the first three cohorts.
Additional scholarships are also available from Hartnell and
CSUMB.</p>
