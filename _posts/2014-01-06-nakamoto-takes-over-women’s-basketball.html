<p>By Kevin Gilmore</p>
<p>It may seem like a contradiction, but Kerri
Nakamoto came to familiar territory for the first time as she made
her way up Highway 101 this summer to become the seventh head coach
in Cal State Monterey Bay women&#x2019;s basketball history. She&#x2019;s making
her third stop along the California coast after playing
collegiately at the University of San Diego and serving as an
assistant coach at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.</p>
<p>At CSUMB, Nakamoto succeeds Renee Jimenez, who left to take a
similar position at Cal State San Bernardino. Nakamoto and Jimenez
will face off in a nationally televised game Feb. 15, when CSU
Monterey Bay meets CSU San Bernardino in the Otter Sports Center.
The game will be broadcast on the CBS Sports Network.</p>
<p>Nakamoto spent the past eight seasons helping Cal Poly become a
perennial Big West Conference contender. The Mustangs captured the
Big West regular season titles in 2011 and 2012 before earning an
NCAA Tournament bid by winning the conference championship
tournament title last season.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The opportunity to run my own program is one I&#x2019;ve always
dreamed of,&#x201D; Nakamoto said. &#x201C;Every person I met on campus seemed to
love the experience of being there and that really helped make it
feel like the right fit for me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She served in a variety of capacities on the Cal Poly staff,
including player development, academic advising and recruiting. In
fact, she helped spearhead the recruiting efforts that produced the
past four Big West Conference players of the year.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Kerri brings experience, positive energy and a collaborative
spirit to CSUMB women&#x2019;s basketball,&#x201D; said CSUMB Interim Director of
Athletics Kirby Garry. &#x201C;We look forward to the future of our
program under her leadership.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She joins an Otter team that has enjoyed its share of success in
recent years. The Otters have advanced to the NCAA Division II
Tournament the past three seasons. They won the CCAA regular season
championship in 2011 and the CCAA Tournament title in 2012.</p>
<p>While appreciating her own past successes, she&#x2019;s looking forward
to the opportunities at Cal State Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Over the years I&#x2019;ve learned a lot to help prepare for this
opportunity,&#x201D; Nakamoto said. &#x201C;I cannot ask for a better university
to begin my journey as a new head coach.&#x201D;</p>
