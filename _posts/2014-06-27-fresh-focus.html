<h3>Kirby Garry brings changes to CSUMB athletics program</h3>
<p class="small">By KEVIN GILMORE</p>
<p class="intro">Since becoming director of athletics at Cal State
Monterey Bay last November, Kirby Garry has already succeeded in
shining a national spotlight on the university. He&#x2019;s also quickly
establishing Otter Athletics as a national leader in social media
marketing, while maintaining its commitment to academic
achievement.</p>
<p>Garry began his term as interim director of
athletics July 8, replacing Vince Otoupal, who left to become
director of athletics at NCAA Division I member Utah Valley
University. CSUMB Vice President for Student Affairs Ronnie Higgs
made the appointment permanent on Nov. 5.</p>
<p>Garry joined the Otter Athletics team in 2008 as assistant
athletics director of external operations. His areas of oversight
have included all aspects of athletics communications, corporate
partnerships, development and marketing.</p>
<p>Garry graduated cum laude with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in social
science from the University of North Dakota and earned his master&#x2019;s
in athletics administration from the University of South
Dakota.</p>
<p>Arriving at CSUMB with strong experience as an administrator,
coach and student&#x2013;athlete, Garry served in athletics administration
roles at both Washington State University and Idaho State
University after four years as an assistant football coach at
USD.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We talk a lot about making the big-time where you are, and for
us, big-time starts in the classroom,&#x201D; Garry said. &#x201C;More than 60
percent of our student&#x2013;athletes carry a cumulative grade-point
average of 3.0 or greater. By percentage, we have more students win
conference academic honors from the California Collegiate Athletic
Association than any other institution.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Otters also have hung more than their share of championship
banners around campus.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Despite being the youngest institution &#x2014; not
athletic program, institution &#x2014; in all of NCAA Division II sports,&#x201D;
he said, &#x201C;we already have won an NCAA national title [men&#x2019;s golf in
2011] and have 14 CCAA titles in seven years as a conference
member.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Those successes helped bring another honor to CSUMB when the
Otter women&#x2019;s basketball team hosted Cal State San Bernardino in a
Feb. 15 game broadcast on the CBS Sports Network. It&#x2019;s not often
that a small school gets to host a live, nationally televised game
on a major sports network.</p>
<p>Garry was instrumental in making that happen, working behind the
scenes with NCAA leadership to help CSUMB earn a spot as one of
eight Division II basketball programs to host a game on CBS this
year. In fact, it was Garry&#x2019;s status as a national leader in NCAA
social media development that led to the game being designated the
Division II Social Media Game of the Year.</p>
<p>The NCAA sent a production crew to document CSUMB&#x2019;s uses of
social media for a &#x201C;best practices&#x201D; piece to be presented at the
national convention.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re always looking for ways to gain a little ground or to
separate ourselves,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Social media offers us a free
platform with multiple ways of doing that. We stood out enough that
the NCAA decided to shine a spotlight here.&#x201D;
