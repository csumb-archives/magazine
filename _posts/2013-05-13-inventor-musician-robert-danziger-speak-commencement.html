<p>A couple of years ago, Robert Danziger
decided to focus his wide-ranging imagination on one task.</p>
<p>So, now he is rewriting Bach&#x2019;s Brandenburg Concerto
full-time.</p>
<p>If that seems improbable&#xA0;to you, you probably haven&#x2019;t met
Danziger, or perused his resum&#xE9;. He landed a job at the California
Institute of Technology&#x2019;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, despite not
having an undergraduate degree. He founded&#xA0;a sustainable
energy company while still in his 20s. He has been issued 10
patents, includ- ing one for a &#x201C;Walking Chair,&#x201D; which he uses to
help overcome his own mobility issues.</p>
<p>And he played kalimba, an African instrument also known as a
thumb piano, on a Supertramp album.</p>
<p>The Carmel resident received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts
from Cal State Monterey Bay in September 2011, in recognition of
his accomplishments as a musician, inventor and sustainable energy
pioneer. Danziger will share stories and lessons from his varied
career when he serves as the keynote speaker for Cal State Monterey
Bay&#x2019;s com- mencement on May 18.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a classical musician; I am coming at it basically from
a jazz point of view,&#x201D; Danziger said of his work on the Bach
concerto. &#x201C;Who knows if it will ever have an audience? I am just
trying to do the very, very best thing I can with it, and not
really trying to define it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That philosophy has been apparent throughout Danziger&#x2019;s career
as he has faced and surmounted challenges just&#xA0;because they
seemed worth doing.</p>
<p>His work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory gave him a front-row
look at one of the space age&#x2019;s most ambitious projects, the Voyager
exploration into deep space.</p>
<p>Danziger wrote &#x201C;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way&#xA0;to Energy
Independence,&#x201D; which recounts stories from his careers in energy
and music. He composed several sound sculptures, which have been
part&#xA0;of exhibitions at the Monterey Museum of Art and the
National Steinbeck Center.</p>
<p>As for his message to graduates, Danziger said, &#x201C;We have
students here who are challenged to compete with people from Yale
and Harvard and MIT, just as I had to. And if you have the honor,
the integrity and the fire in the belly, you can make it. You can
be as insightful and successful as anyone from any of those
schools.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They have earned the opportunity to look inside themselves and
be everything they possibly can be and make their mark.&#x201D;</p>
