<h4>New chancellor leads CSU system</h4>
<p>Dr. Timothy White took over as chancellor of the California
State University system in late December, replacing Charles Reed,
who retired after 14 years.</p>
<p>White had been chancellor of the University of California at
Riverside. Earlier in his career, he served as provost at Oregon
State University and then president of the University of Idaho. He
earned degrees from Diablo Community College, Fresno State
University, Cal State Hayward (now East Bay) and UC Berkeley.</p>
<h4>University offers&#xA0;fully online degree&#xA0;programs</h4>
<p>CSUMB is among the first CSU campuses to offer degrees through
Cal State Online, an initiative intended to expand access to fully
online bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degrees.</p>
<p>Two master of science degree programs are available through
CSUMB, one in instructional science and technology, and another in
management and information technology.</p>
<h4>CSUMB honored&#xA0;for branding&#xA0;campaign</h4>
<p>CSUMB earned an Award of Excellence from the Council for the
Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) for its branding
campaign.</p>
<p>Launched in the&#xA0;fall of 2012, ads pre- pared for the
campaign have been running in local newspapers and websites, and on
a sign at Monterey Regional Airport. The new tagline, &#x201C;A Place of
Extraordinary Opportunity,&#x201D; has been integrated into the
university&#x2019;s website and other messages.<br>
