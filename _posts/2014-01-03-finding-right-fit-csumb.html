<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve always believed that your choice of
school and career is about what fits you, not what someone else
wants you to do or be.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Libby Padilla, development and alumni coordinator for Lycee
International de Los Angeles, is happy she decided to attend Cal
State Monterey Bay. She is committed to helping future students
along the same path.</p>
<p>&#x201C;CSUMB gave me so much in the sense of a great education and
amazing memories that I felt that<br>
giving back was the best way to show my Otter pride,&#x201D; Padilla said.
&#x201C;I want others to have the same opportunities I did.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She views with delight the growth of her alma mater: &#x201C;We now
have a beautiful library, a science building, real dining commons,
and a student lounge, all because of fellow alumni and donors who
believed in CSUMB and gave.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Padilla has given back since graduating in 2007. Her gifts have
been directed to the Alumni Association and the annual fund, most
recently supporting the 2013 Faculty Incentive Grant program.</p>
<p>While the campus continues to change, the factors that attracted
Padilla have not.</p>
<p>&#x201C;During my junior year of high school I had a very specific list
of what I wanted in a university,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Top of my list was
student/teacher ratio, location, and a diverse business
program.</p>
<p>&#x201C;CSUMB had everything on my list, and better yet it was near the
beach. I felt a sense of belonging, and it remained true over my
five years as a student.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
