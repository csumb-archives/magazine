Telecommunications, Multimedia &amp; Applied Computing &#x2019;02</h5>
<p>Greg and his business partner, Carson Franklin, were working for
a Silicon Valley-based IT consulting company that served the
Monterey Bay area. &#x201C;We felt that they were out of touch with the
specific needs of companies in Monterey County and beyond,&#x201D; he
said. So in 2007 they founded CCIS to provide IT services to
Tri-County businesses. Five years later, their business is still
growing.</p>

<h3>Alumni entrepreneurs share their experience</h3>
<p><strong>What are the challenges of running your own
business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jose</strong>: Is there a short list? For a small
business I think not. Every day is a challenge; (the restaurant
industry) is one of the toughest as a sole proprietor. Margins are
low, demand is volatile &#x2013; restaurants are the first to suffer when
the economy dips. Work days are long and forget vacations. If you
want to see your business thrive, it is vital that you give 200
percent.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> Initially, learning to properly evaluate
and bid on projects, so as to not shoot ourselves in the foot. You
learn a new lesson with each project, and learn not to repeat
mistakes.<br>
Also, wearing the many &#x201C;hats&#x201D; required to run a business. We take
on all the roles required, which include not only managing and
build- ing the projects, but also acting as bookkeeper, lawyer,
accountant, marketing and sales reps, IT/systems admins, and so
much more.</p>
<p><strong>Robert:</strong> The challenges are financing. With the
downturn in the economy, many investors are looking for more
safe-bet films, films with named actors attached, and that&#x2019;s great.
But the result has been that it&#x2019;s harder to build a career when you
need a named actor at- tached to your project to get it made. It
requires that you may decide on someone known rather than someone
right for the part.</p>
<p><strong>How did your education prepare you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jose:</strong> After my graduation, I proposed to my
family that I had gained the tools to build this new concept and
that I was now quali- fied to be the primary decision maker. CSUMB
prepared me with<br>
an understanding of how to implement our vision and use busi- ness
strategies to build our brand and position ourselves in a tough
market.</p>
<p><strong>J.P.:</strong> I had the opportunity to come to college
and study environ- mental science. I became interested in organic
farming after learning and seeing the negative effects of
pesticides on the environment and our bodies. Since my family has a
background in farming it just seemed like the right path to
take.<br>
CSUMB was the key element to our decision to grow organic. Earth
Systems Science &amp; Policy lead us to a more sustainable and
earth friendly way of growing produce. It gave me the knowledge to
make decisions while considering how all parties may be
affected.</p>
<p><strong>Dana:</strong> When I went back to school, my goal was
to acquire skills that built upon my strengths &#x2013; people, writing
and technology. I&#x2019;m now working in Internet marketing that requires
content writing with a focus on people and a need for backend
technology and code. I also do a lot of training in my work. Having
the opportunity to teach web design after I graduated and many of
the skills learned studying instructional technology were
invaluable.</p>
<p><strong>What&#x2019;s the best part of the job?</strong></p>
<p><strong>J.P.:</strong> Everything! I like the farming aspect, I
like packing with my brother and listening to music, driving my van
while eating a basket full of organic strawberries, delivering to
people&#x2019;s houses (even if I have to run away from dogs)... Everyday
is different.</p>
<p><strong>Dana:</strong> The people. I get to work with a wide
range of people&#xA0;and learn a lot about diverse industries. I
get a chance to work my strengths and outsource my weaknesses. I&#x2019;m
able to work from home and collaborate with those who work with me
remotely. I travel to meet with clients and to attend and speak at
industry conferences. I&#x2019;m networked with a number of incredibly
smart people who chal- lenge me regularly, and I&#x2019;m constantly
learning.</p>
<p><strong>Greg:</strong> I can&#x2019;t sit still. I hate sitting at a
desk. This job allows me to be at a different locale every few
hours. I see the coast in the morn- ing and the strawberry fields
in the afternoon. It&#x2019;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for others who might be thinking
about starting a business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Greg:</strong> Find a niche that you can sell. And just
do it. Do it now. Don&#x2019;t wait until you are financially secure or
have a perfect busi- ness plan. Because you know what? That time
will never come. You will blink, and in a flash you will have a
house, wife and child. Then what are you going to do? Start a
business that &#x201C;might&#x201D; fail and lose your livelihood? No, of course
not. Start it now while you are young and don&#x2019;t mind crashing
couches, eating ramen, and have no real responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Robert:</strong> I think when you start a business, you
have to know it&#x2019;s something you will love to do, rather the
thinking about the im- mediate financial gain. We are three years
into this business and still building. But I look towards the
future of what we will be able to do &#x2013; I think you need that,
because it does take years to build a strong, sustainable
business.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> Choose partners that you trust like
family. Get a good and thorough accountant. Have predetermined
definitions of success and failure. Have an exit plan. Be prepared
to work long hours, as running a business involves a lot of time
spent on tasks aside from the work itself. And stretch a lot...
we&#x2019;re not built to spend 12 hours a day in a chair.<br>
