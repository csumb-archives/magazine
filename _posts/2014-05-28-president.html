<h3>Dear friends of Cal State Monterey Bay,</h3>
<p></p>
<p>As Cal State Monterey Bay continues to grow and mature as a
university, my goal is to have it play an ever more important role
in public discussions about issues facing the Central Coast.</p>
<p>As we help bring new ideas to the table, we can help community
leaders look at familiar problems from new perspectives.</p>
<p>That was the goal of this year&#x2019;s President&#x2019;s Speaker Series,
which brought three nationally recognized speakers to our campus
during the spring semester. Its theme was &#x201C;Flourish Monterey
County,&#x201D; as we explored the economic, educational and criminal
justice challenges facing the Central Coast region.</p>
<p>Our speakers were Mary Jo Waits, director of the Economic, Human
Services &amp; Workforce Division of the National Governors
Association; David Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime
Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and
former director of the Boston Gun Project; and Jeff Edmonson,
managing director of Strive Together, the national group with whom
we are working as we establish our own Cradle to Career
pipeline.</p>
<p>Their public presentations, held at the World Theater, were
excellent and well-attended. Equally important were the sessions
each speaker held with campus and community representatives to
discuss their ideas in even greater depth.</p>
<p>To cite just one example, it was fascinating for me to listen to
police chiefs from around our county engage in an open, thoughtful
and heartfelt discussion with Mr. Kennedy about how best to cope
with the plague of gang violence that has struck too many of our
communities.</p>
<p>Each of the local public safety officials brought vast
experience to that roundtable discussion. Each shared an interest
in discussing new ideas and finding out what was working
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Universities provide forums where learning happens. While the
interests of students in our classrooms and laboratories will
always be paramount, we also have an important obligation to reach
out into the larger community.</p>
<p>At Cal State Monterey Bay, we are proud to be our county&#x2019;s
four-year public university and are eager to take on all the
responsibilities that role entails.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eduardo M. Ochoa, President</p>
