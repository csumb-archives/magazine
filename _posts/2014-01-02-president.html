<p>Dear friends of Cal State Monterey Bay,</p>
<p>When President Barack Obama presented his plan this summer to
make college more affordable, it was met by, at best, restrained
applause.</p>
<p>Clearly, any wide-ranging effort to institute a new rating
system for colleges and universities, to change the way federal
financial aid is funded, to encourage the use of new classroom
technologies and to introduce new repayment options for college
loans will pick up critics at many stops along the way.</p>
<p>However, whether the president&#x2019;s proposals are enacted or not,
the discussions that these ideas encourage are exactly the ones we
need to have.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we control rising tuition and student loan debt?</li>
<li>How do we measure educational outcomes?</li>
<li>How do we explain those outcomes in a way that would be most
helpful for prospective students and their parents?</li>
</ul>
<p>As this debate moves forward, Cal State Monterey Bay has some
clear strengths. Despite tuition increases in recent years caused
by reductions in state funding, the Cal State system remains among
the nation&#x2019;s most affordable public university options. In 2012-13,
in-state public university tuition and fees nationwide averaged
$8,655. For CSUMB, that figure was $5,963, and it remains the same
this year.<br>
In part because of lower fees, Cal State graduates tend to have
lower student loan burdens than do students nationwide.</p>
<p>One laudable aspect of the president&#x2019;s proposals is the attempt
to measure educational outcomes. Too many college ratings focus on
inputs &#x2013; amount spent per student or the academic qualifications of
incoming students, for example &#x2013; and not on results.</p>
<p>I believe CSUMB has a strong story to tell in this regard. We
admit many first-generation and low-income students and help them
become college graduates. Through unique experiences like service
learning and capstone projects, we provide them not only with
multidisciplinary knowledge, but also with the real-world skills
they will need in their careers and in life.</p>
<p>Can we do better? Undoubtedly. In student retention and
graduation rates, while we have been</p></div></div></div>ntion and
graduation rates, while we have been improving, we still have far
to go. When looking at outcomes, degree attainment is a vital
measure; we must improve our performance without watering down the
education our students receive.</p>
<p>Our most important message is that we welcome accountability. We
owe that to our students, to our donors, and to California&#x2019;s
taxpayers.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eduardo M. Ochoa, President</p>
