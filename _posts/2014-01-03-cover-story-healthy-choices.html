<h5>CSUMB comes together to help community understand and prepare
for Affordable Care Act</h5>
<p>By James Tinney</p>
<p>Passage of the Affordable Care Act was a signature event of
Barack Obama&#x2019;s first presidential term. It touched off a
continuing, heated political debate and was upheld as
constitutional in a much-awaited ruling by the U.S. Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>But, in talking to his classmates, Cal State Monterey Bay senior
Tyller Williamson found they knew little about the law, also known
as Obamacare.</p>
<p>Although the participation of young adults is widely
acknowledged to be critical in making Obamacare work, polls show
little understanding of the law among that age group &#x2013; or most
other age groups, for that matter.&#x201C;When you develop an
understanding of a topic, you think other people also will have
some level of understanding. But it is surprising how much
information is just not getting out there,&#x201D; said Williamson, a
Human Communication major finishing his undergraduate degree this
fall.</p>
<p>For Williamson, the run-up to the law became a perfect subject
for his capstone, the final project for graduating seniors to bring
together what they have learned in the course of their studies at
CSUMB.</p>
<p>For CSUMB health officials, the act offers a renewed opportunity
to stress the importance of prevention, early treatment, and
preparing for the unexpected.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CSUMB researchers are helping the local health care
community prepare as well.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Health care is a vexing issue. That is why it is a good issue
for a capstone,&#x201D; said Professor David Reichard, Williamson&#x2019;s
capstone adviser. &#x201C;It really calls for collaboration, listening to
people with multiple points of view.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Collaborative problem solving is one of the things that
students take with them when they leave here.&#xA0;And it is a
critical part of the HComm major.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is a critical part of the political process, as well.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You feel a certain way about it, I feel a certain way about it,
the person next door feels a certain way about it,&#x201D; Williamson
said. &#x201C;We are all part of this system. So how do we go from all of
our individual thoughts to a collective solution?</p>
<p>&#x201C;The best way to do that is democracy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Young adults are a key to helping make the Affordable Care Act
successful. Under the act, they can be covered by their parents&#x2019;
insurance through age 26. Those who are not will need to sign up
for health insurance on their own and may qualify for two programs
designed to facilitate coverage for the uninsured under the
ACA.</p>
<p>For the uninsured who have a yearly income
below 138 percent of the poverty line, the law expands coverage
under Medi-Cal. For the uninsured who make more than 138 percent
but less than 400 percent of the federal poverty line, California
has created a state exchange program, Covered California, through
which people can obtain insurance with the assistance of a sliding
scale of tax subsidies.</p>
<p>Including more young adults in the overall pool is expected to
keep insurance rates down. The law imposes fines on those who don&#x2019;t
get insured.</p>
<p>A child of a military family, Williamson has spent much of his
life on the move, but has been consistently covered by health
insurance. He found, however, that some other young adults had far
different experiences.</p>
<p>This spring, he put together a town hall meeting, which included
a presentation by a young woman who had suffered a traumatic brain
injury as the result of a fall, then had to deal with the difficult
physical and financial aftermath.</p>
<p>The town hall also included a wide spectrum of people involved
in the system &#x2013; including county officials, an insurance agent, a
health-care advocate and representatives of Health and
Wellness&#xA0;Services on the CSUMB campus.</p>
<p>Based on the feedback from those who attended, the town hall was
effective in informing people about the legislation. However,
Williamson said one of the lasting lessons he learned was the
importance of one-on-one communication.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know this sounds crazy, because it is so unachievable,&#x201D;
Williamson said. &#x201C;But I almost think you have to go
door-to-door.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Emma Spellman, a 2013 CSUMB graduate, is coordinating outreach
to Otter students regarding the Affordable Care Act. Working with a
grant from Covered California, she and student educators will be
engaged in exactly that kind of personal communication.</p>
<p class="pullquote">&#x201C;We are all part of this system. So how do we
go from all of our individual thoughts to a collective
solution?&#xA0;The best way to do that is democracy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are going to have students talking to students. That should
bring the message to a more personal level,&#x201D; Spellman said.</p>
<p>Spellman said the student educators will have materials that
will allow them to tell students exactly what their insurance costs
would be under Covered California.</p>
<p>For campus health officials, the law&#x2019;s focus on access to health
care and preparing for the unexpected goes hand-in-hand with their
ongoing message to students.</p>
<p>Gary Rodriguez, health promotion and prevention specialist at
Cal State Monterey Bay, said it is a challenge to convince students
that it is in their best interests to be insured.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What we have to do &#x2013; not to be Debbie Downer here &#x2013; is to let
them know that you never know what might happen in your life, you
could have an accident or some medical condition that could be
pretty catastrophic,&#x201D; Rodriguez said. &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t have health
insurance, it can really have an impact on you financially.&#x201D;</p>
<p>CSUMB students pay a $63 per semester health fee, which entitles
them to basic medical care through the campus health center, run by
Doctors on Duty.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But if you break a bone and have to get an X-ray, that is not a
basic service; that will have to be paid for out of pocket if you
don&#x2019;t have health insurance,&#x201D; Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>While the CSUMB campus health center deals with a finite &#x2013; and
relatively healthy &#x2013; clientele, health authorities for Monterey
County face different, and even more complex, issues with the
advent of the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>Dr. Kim Judson and Dr. Ignacio Navarro of CSUMB&#x2019;s Institute for
Community Collaborative Studies were contracted by the Monterey
County Health Department to help prepare the county for the new
law.<br>
&#x201C;We worked on an analysis of the clinical safety net system. That
turned into a study of how ready the system will be when the
Affordable Care Act goes into effect [Jan. 1, 2014],&#x201D; Dr. Navarro
said.</p>
<p>CSUMB researchers used census data and surveys of doctors,
emergency rooms and clinics to estimate how many new doctors the
county would need to staff safety-net clinics once Obamacare is in
effect. They estimated that 10 more doctors would be needed to
handle the increased demand. Currently, the county&#x2019;s safety net
clinics have about 36 full-time doctors providing care to more than
85,000 patients.<br>
However, even after working on this study, Navarro said it is
difficult to predict how such a sweeping change will affect demand
for health care.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The United States spends on health care an amount almost as big
as the [gross domestic product] of France,&#x201D; Dr. Navarro said. &#x201C;That
is huge. Try to reform it, that is a major undertaking. You can&#x2019;t
do it in one or two years; it is going to take 10 to 20 years for
this to change.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p>

<h5>Sidebar: ACA Timeline</h5>
<p><strong>March 2010</strong><br>
President Obama signs the Affordable Care Act into law.</p>
<p>The act&#x2019;s goals are to increase the quality and affordability of
health care while significantly reducing the number of uninsured
Americans.</p>
<p>It works through mandates on employers and individuals,
expansion of eligibility for state Medicaid plans, tax credits for
low- and middle-income Americans to pay for insurance and insurance
exchanges in each state, through which the uninsured can obtain
insurance.</p>
<p><strong>June 2012</strong><br>
The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of
most of the ACA in the case of the National Federation of
Independent<br>
Business v. Sebelius.</p>
<p>The court upheld the individual mandate to purchase health
insurance. In 2014, every adult who doesn&#x2019;t have health insurance
will have to pay a $95 penalty. The rate of the penalty rises in
both 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p><strong>July 2013</strong><br>
The Obama Administration announced that the employer mandate &#x2013;
which requires employers with more than 50 employees to offer
health insurance to their full-time workers &#x2013; would be delayed by
one year, until 2015.</p>
<p><strong>October 2013</strong><br>
State health-insurance exchanges open for business to provide
health plans.</p>
<p><strong>January 2014</strong><br>
Insurance coverage requirements for individuals go into
effect.&#xA0;</p>
