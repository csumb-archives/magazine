<h5>Internship allows CSUMB junior Barber&#xA0;to learn about the
two sides of science</h5>
<p>Working in an office near Washington, D.C., over the summer,
Tiffany Barber made a critical discovery: She hated being cooped up
indoors all day.</p>
<p>Barber, a junior marine science major from Los Angeles, is part
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x2019;s
Educational Partnership Program for undergraduates. In addition to
financial aid, the program provides summer internships for students
who major in fields related to NOAA&#x2019;s mission.</p>
<p>Barber was assigned to the agency&#x2019;s National
Marine Fisheries Service in Silver Spring, Maryland.</p>
<p>She worked in a cubicle in one of the four buildings on the NOAA
campus. Her summer project was to complete a literature review of
accounts of killer whale attacks on marine mammals worldwide.</p>
<p>At the end of her eight-week internship, she wrote a paper and
made a presentation to a research symposium.</p>
<p>Though she enjoyed the experience, she decided that working in a
cubicle wasn&#x2019;t for her.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now I understand the other side of science,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;There
are two sides: field and desk. I like field science. I like to be
outside and actually collecting the research.&#x201D; She was quick to
add, however, that she has learned to value the work of analyzing
data, even if it isn&#x2019;t what she wants to do.</p>
<p>Her NOAA mentor &#x201C;taught me a lot about what it takes to be a
researcher,&#x201D; Barber said. &#x201C;Her advice helped me to understand how
to act as a scientist and what is expected of me if I want to
attend graduate school.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Another scientist suggested she study coral reefs since she&#x2019;s
interested in how temperature affects the behavior of marine
invertebrates. That suggestion appealed to her; she hopes to land a
research project in Hawaii next summer to do just that.</p>
<p>Another discovery she made while on her internship in D.C. was
more predictable: &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t like the weather.&#x201D;</p>
