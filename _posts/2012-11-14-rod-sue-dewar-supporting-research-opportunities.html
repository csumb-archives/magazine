<p>CSUMB students can intern with NASA, do
social work in underprivileged neighborhoods or labor on a ship
miles off the coast. They have research experiences with
institutions such as Caltech, Hopkins Marine Station and Rutgers
University. It&#x2019;s all possible thanks to the Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Center (UROC) and supporters like Rod and Sue
Dewar.</p>
<p>The Dewars recently made a planned gift to CSUMB to support
programs like UROC. Rod Dewar, a Monterey attorney, said the
program can be a life-changing event for students. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s practical
study versus classroom activity; working with experts in the
student&#x2019;s chosen field at off-campus locations,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;UROC exposes students to incredible opportunities not usually
afforded to undergraduates &#x2013; a concentrated activity leading to a
contribution to knowledge rather than just absorbing it.&#x201D;<br>
Students can then demonstrate how their research addresses real
world issues said Sue Dewar, who also actively supports
scholarships for re-entry students as a member of the Women&#x2019;s
Leadership Council. &#x201C;I saw a student presentation at the UROC
offices and it was impressive,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Sue commended CSUMB University Advancement for its
professionalism and introducing them to UROC and other aspects of
campus life. She encouraged other community members to get
involved.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Rod and Sue have been supporters of CSUMB for nearly a decade.
