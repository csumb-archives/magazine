<h3>Zack Krone is making the world a better place &#x2014;<br>
one bid at a time</h3>
<p class="small">By SCOTT ROARK</p>
<p class="intro">The lights dim. The microphone clicks on. The
clamor of excited conversation, clinking glasses and laughter fades
slightly. A prominent figure on stage begins speaking&#x2014;a clear,
rapid-fire dialogue that commands attention and generates an
undercurrent of excitement as numbers are called out. First it&#x2019;s a
dollar, then $10, then $20, then $50, before accelerating to $100,
$150 and $200. The amount increases exponentially.</p>
<p>Zack Krone (TAT &#x2019;05) is kicking off another successful benefit
auction in his usual style &#x2013; by selling a plain glass of water to
encourage people into the spirit of giving. Sound far-fetched? At
the CSUMB Have a Heart for Students auction in February, Krone sold
a glass of water for $525. The glass was personally delivered by
Krone to the winning bidder seated in the audience and included
free refills.</p>
<p>Krone is the owner and operator of California Coast Auctions, an
Orange County-based firm which specializes in benefit auctions.
Since its inception, California Coast Auctions has raised millions
of dollars for hundreds of organizations nationwide. Krone has
worked with many high-profile charities and celebrities.</p>
<p>Why does he do it? Krone leans back in his chair at his
company&#x2019;s office, thoughtfully considering a desktop plaque that
contains a favorite quote by Oscar Wilde: &#x201C;It is only an auctioneer
who can equally and impartially admire all schools of art.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a great need for what we do &#x2026; and I love being my own
boss,&#x201D; Krone said with a smile.</p>
<p>Krone is known specifically as a benefit auctioneer, a big
difference from a regular auctioneer. Benefit auctioneers are
involved early on in many aspects of the event-planning process,
providing input on details such as timing, printed materials and
seating arrangements. It&#x2019;s a complete package &#x2013; one designed to
inspire an environment of inspired giving.</p>
<p>According to Krone, the tools and ability to create this
environment came directly from the CSUMB Teledramatic Arts and
Technology Department, now known as Cinematic Arts and Technology.
The curriculum is hands-on and practical.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Students had a camera in their hand from day one,&#x201D; he said.
&#x201C;The lesson at TAT was to push yourself and see what you&#x2019;re capable
of. It cultivated drive and self-discipline.&#x201D; He cites TAT faculty
as significant influences, including Chris Carpenter, Steven
Levinson, Benny Ambush and Hiromasa Konishi.</p>
<p>CSUMB&#x2019;s emphasis on service learning played a role in Krone&#x2019;s
current focus on charity. He volunteered extensively, tutoring
children at libraries in Salinas and San Juan Bautista. An avid
surfer, he also performed many beach clean-ups while working 20 to
30 hours a week, acting in plays at CSUMB and living in a converted
garage.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t want to share a room with anybody,&#x201D; he recalled
fondly. &#x201C;It was a very formative time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>An impressive career followed. Krone has starred in more than 30
professional theatrical productions and dozens of commercials and
guest TV/film appearances. Krone also worked as a production
coordinator on TV shows such as &#x201C;Southland,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Middleman&#x201D; and
several pilot productions for Warner Bros., ABC, NBC and Sony
Pictures Television.</p>
<p>Becoming an auctioneer was almost a fluke. Krone was working in
TV and serving as a master of ceremonies at an occasional
fundraiser. One night, the auctioneer failed to show up. Krone
filled in and discovered his true calling. Shortly after, he
graduated from the World Wide College of Auctioneering in Mason
City, Iowa. He&#x2019;s been looking for the highest bidders ever
since.</p>
<p>Married to Dawn, a Chicago native, and back in Orange County
where he grew up, Krone is living his passion. His father managed a
car dealership. His mother was a nurse. For Krone, show business
was always a true calling &#x2013; and his performance makes an impact in
a different way, providing resources to those most in need.</p>
<p>Now, it starts with a glass of water. Perhaps it&#x2019;s symbolic.
Some would call it a simple prop. Regardless, that glass of water
can begin a night that raises hundreds of thousands of dollars,
driving California Coast Auctions&#x2019; goal of uniting commerce and
entertainment with charity, schools and nonprofits.</p>
<p>In the end, Krone is helping these organizations help
themselves.</p>
<p>The world is what you make of it,&#x201D; Krone said. &#x201C;CSUMB definitely
taught me that.&#x201D; <strong>MB</strong></p>
