<p class="intro">I wasn&#x2019;t sure what a ropes challenge course was,
but it sounded like fun.</p>
<p>I arrived at the course, which was organized
by Outdoor Recreation and is in the woods surrounding campus. It
looked like a lot of high wooden pillars with ropes between them.
I&#x2019;ve never seen one back home.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You wanna try this one?&#x201D; asked the course leader.</p>
<p>She showed me a pillar that was separated from the others. It
turned out to be one of the most challenging.</p>
<p>&#x201C;So, what you do is just climb up to the top,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It
gets a bit wiggly and windy on the top, but when you get there, you
should stand up straight on the top of the pillar.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And then?&#x201D; I asked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then you jump!&#x201D;</p>
<p>I decided not to think about it too much. I started climbing.
The only thing I could hold onto was the pillar; it had small
steps, so it wasn&#x2019;t hard to climb. Apart from that, I just had my
security rope for getting down. I was on my own. When I got to the
top, it was kind of scary to stand up &#x2013; the wind was blowing and
the pillar was shaky. I stood up and looked around. The view was
really cool: It was foggy, so all I saw was green trees and fog.
Usually, you can see the ocean from there.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now just jump!&#x201D;</p>
<p>I looked down and realized I was really high, and I had nothing
but the rope on my back. It all happened a bit fast and
unexpectedly, so I felt kind of surprised to find myself all the
way up there.</p>
<p>But I jumped!</p>
<p>And it was so nice, and exciting. I didn&#x2019;t
even feel the impact on my back from jumping, because of all the
belts I had on me. I slowly came down, and the girl congratulated
me and unhooked the rope from my belt. My legs felt a bit shaky
from the adrenaline.</p>
<p>The shaky legs didn&#x2019;t help when I tried the next challenge,
where I climbed up an even higher pillar and had to get to the
other one by crossing over a wooden log. Being so high without
anything to hold onto makes you nervous, which makes you panic and
lose your balance. I thought the course would be more physically
challenging, but in fact, it was mostly a mental challenge of
overcoming the boundaries you set for yourself.</p>
<p>I really liked the one you do in a pair: You and your partner
cross the distance between pillars over a thin rope, without
anything to hold on to. In order to get from one bar to another,
you have to work with your partner &#x2014; they hold you while you let go
of the bar and walk to the next one. When you reach it, you help
your partner across.</p>
<p>I felt so confident about myself! I got so confident that at the
end I even did the challenge with the log once more, but
blindfolded. I realized it was all in my head. I was actually very
secure, so I needed to calm my mind and trust my abilities. You
can&#x2019;t let yourself panic. You must trust yourself and just start
going. <strong>MB</strong></p>
