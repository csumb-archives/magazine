<p><strong>Explain what your business
does?</strong></p>
<p>Definition is a complete media solution provider, offering
design and development services for interactive and traditional
media. Recently, Definition designed and developed a powerful new
beer review app called Beer Citizen.</p>
<p><strong>When did you start it?</strong></p>
<p>Definition: March 2004<br>
Beer Citizen launched mid-2012</p>
<p><strong>Why did you start it?</strong></p>
<p>We started Definition simply because it made sense at the time.
We were each working on a variety of freelance jobs, and realized
if we got an office and started a proper business, we could help
each other with the work we had, and take on larger projects as a
team.</p>
<p><strong>How did the recession affect you and your
business?</strong></p>
<p>We&#x2019;ve found that in an economic downturn, the last thing our
clients cut back on is their online presence, as that increasingly
becomes a key revenue stream. That, by no means, makes our line of
work recession-proof, but in our case we were able to keep busy
with a wide variety of work throughout the recession.</p>
<p><strong>What do you like about your work?</strong></p>
<p>Diversity. Being able to take the business in a new direction if
we feel we need to, and being able to reinvent ourselves along the
way, both in how we operate the business as well as how we approach
the needs of a project or client.</p>
<p>Launching Beer Citizen is a great example of the diversity and
flexibility we enjoy as a self-owned business. In 2011, we decided
that we wanted to do something that would revitalize our
creativity, which isn&#x2019;t always a priority with client projects.
That something involved leveraging our technical development and
design skills to build a new kind of beer review application that
we, ourselves, would want to use. Today, Beer Citizen is a thriving
community of beer lovers from around the world and we&#x2019;ve got big
plans for the future. For all the headaches involved in owning a
business, opportunities like this make them worth it.</p>
<p><strong>What are the challenges?</strong></p>
<p>Initially, learning to properly evaluate and bid on projects, so
as to not shoot ourselves in the foot. You learn a new lesson with
each project, and learn not to repeat mistakes.</p>
<p>Also, wearing the many &quot;hats&quot; required to run a business. We
take on all the roles required, which include not only managing and
building the projects, but also acting as bookkeeper, lawyer,
accountant, marketing and sales reps, IT/sysadmins, and so much
more.</p>
<p><strong>How did your CSUMB education prepare you?</strong></p>
<p>All three of us had the benefit of not only attending CSUMB, but
also working for the university. That, for us, was one added
benefit of CSUMB. There&apos;s a lot of opportunity to learn from
faculty and staff outside of the traditional classroom environment.
CSUMB is an environment where you can get more out of it if you put
more in, and really engage with the community.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any advice for others who may be considering
starting a business?</strong></p>
<p>Choose partners that you trust like family. Get a good and
thorough accountant. Have predetermined definitions of success and
failure. Have an exit plan. Be prepared to work long hours, as
running a business involves a lot of time spent on tasks aside from
the work itself.</p>
<p><strong>Anything else you&apos;d like to add?</strong></p>
<p>Stretch a lot... we&#x2019;re not built to spend 12 hours a day in a
chair.<br>
