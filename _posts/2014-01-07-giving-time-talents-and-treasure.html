<p>As a founding faculty member of Cal State
Monterey Bay, Dr. Christine Sleeter has contributed her talents to
the building of this university.</p>
<p>Sleeter, an expert on multicultural education and diversity in
the schools, has contributed financially as well. Since 1995, she
has made gifts to provide students the same kind of opportunities
that she once had.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I started donating book royalties because I was struck by the
sacrifices many students were making,&#x201D; said Sleeter, a professor
emerita in the College of Professional Studies.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When I was an undergraduate, extended family supported me and
my siblings in going to college. I worked a few hours a week, and
had a small scholarship, but the family support meant that I could
focus mainly on my studies.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In contrast, I saw many of my first-generation university
students holding down jobs, full-time in some cases, taking out
loans, sometimes raising children, all while trying to also focus
on their studies.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sleeter has helped countless students through her gifts to the
Ron Cisneros Vision Scholarship, which supports high-achieving,
first-generation, low-income, and historically underserved
students. Most recently, Sleeter has increased her impact on the
lives of students by opening a gift annuity to benefit the
Undergraduate Research Opportunity Center (UROC).</p>
<p>She is proud of CSUMB&#x2019;s commitment to educating a diverse group
of students, many of them seeking to become the first in their
family to earn a degree.</p>
<p>To them, she offers straightforward advice.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Believe in yourself. You&#x2019;re probably capable of doing much more
than you realize. Working hard on your education is one of the best
things you can do, because you&#x2019;re actually investing in yourself.
