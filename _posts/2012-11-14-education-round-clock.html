<p>Lin Philpott, a junior from Castro Valley, recalls camping with
professors Pam Motoike and Deborah Burke of the Service Learning
Institute during her freshman year. &#x201C;We bonded while making our
dinner over the campfire,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;I felt more connected to the
campus. Taking a class and living together, we felt like
family.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Lin was part of <a href="http://housing.csumb.org/project-higher-ground" rel="nofollow">Project Higher Ground</a> &#x2013; a residential community in
Avocet Hall linked to academic coursework and extracurricular
activities designed to enhance student learning and personal
development.</p>
<p>Now in its third year, Project Higher Ground is made up of
student groups based on academic and personal interests such as
math, computer science, health, ethnic experiences and biology.
Students in each group take a First Year Seminar course that
directly ties with an additional course. For example, students may
take a seminar on Technology and Society that connects with their
section of pre-calculus. Faculty members from both courses work
together to make a seamless transition from one class to the
next.</p>
<p>Outside of class, two peer leaders coordinate
activities to integrate students&#x2019; coursework with campus and
community experiences. This year they look forward to taking field
trips to Silicon Valley companies, exploring possible careers,
doing special projects that showcase their skills such as making
cellphone apps, and, of course, social activities such as pizza
parties in the Avocet lounge.</p>
<p>The name Project Higher Ground was taken from the book, Moving
to Higher Ground: How Jazz Can Change Your Life, in which Pulitzer
Prize-winning musician and jazz educator Wynton Marsalis relates
the principles of jazz to lessons about life. When a jazz ensemble
&#x201C;swings,&#x201D; each individual expresses a unique creativity, but
through intense listening, and respect for each other&#x2019;s rhythms and
sounds, the group creates music that transcends. He calls it
&#x201C;ascending through engagement,&#x201D;&#x2013; reaching a higher ground.</p>
<p>The university&#x2019;s Student Life and Academic Affairs divisions,
which co-sponsor Project Higher Ground, have seen an increase in
student satisfaction and academic success as a result of this
program. All involved agree, it&#x2019;s a great start on the CSUMB
experience. &#xA0;</p>
