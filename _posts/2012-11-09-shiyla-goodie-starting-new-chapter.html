NAACP charter members (from left to right) Janelle Pichon, Charity

<p>Shiyla Goodie described attending the NAACP&#x2019;s national
conference in Houston this year as &#x201C;a life-changing experience.&#x201D;
She&#x2019;d spent the previous semester organizing potential members and
filing stacks of paperwork in order to establish an official NAACP
chapter at CSUMB. In Houston, Shiyla witnessed thousands of people
from all over the country working together to advance civil rights
and saw firsthand how she and her fellow students could contribute
to the NAACP&#x2019;s mission. &#x201C;There is power in numbers when people come
together,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>The CSUMB chapter was chartered on July 26, and members held
their inaugural meeting Sept. 7, with Shiyla presiding as chapter
president. Now, the group is moving ahead with educational
activities for the campus and service projects in the local
community. For example, they&#x2019;ve partnered with The Village Project,
a local nonprofit, to provide mentoring services to local youth who
have exhibited behavior problems.</p>
<p>Shiyla&#x2019;s academic interests are aligned with her
extracurriculars. A psychology major with a minor in journalism and
media studies, Shiyla is engaged in research on the way television
depicts marital roles and the influence that has on the perception
of marriage among African American young adults. She hopes to
expand on this research in graduate school.</p>
