<h3>New nursing program accommodates working professionals</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay is expanding its nursing program. Starting in
June, the program will add a track for already-employed nurses with
associate&#x2019;s degrees who want to earn a bachelor&#x2019;s while they
continue to work.</p>
<p>Classes will be held in the late afternoons and evenings; some
will be traditional face-to-face classes, some will be online. The
curriculum will include courses on research methods, evidence-based
practice, health policy, informatics, genomics and chronic care
management.</p>
<p>Classes will be offered throughout the year; students can
graduate in 14 months.</p>
<p>In addition to nurses who are currently employed, the program
will admit recent community college nursing graduates.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The idea is for a seamless transition from community college to
CSUMB,&#x201D; said Dr. Marianne Hultgren, interim director of
nursing.</p>
<p>The university started its nursing program in 2012, in
partnership with four local community colleges.</p>

Summer Arts returns to campus</h3>
<p>CSU Summer Arts returns to campus for a third
year in late June with a lineup of 16 classes and dozens of public
events.</p>
<p>Students &#x2013; who come from CSU campuses, other four-year and
two-year colleges as well as the local community &#x2013; are immersed in
rigorous training up to 12 hours a day during the two-week
sessions.</p>
<p>Classes are offered in dance, music, theater, creative writing,
visual arts and filmmaking.</p>
<p>Public events include lectures, concerts and theatrical
productions, all priced to make them accessible to a wide audience.
In addition, each course concludes with a free public performance
or &#x201C;culmination,&#x201D; where students showcase their talents.</p>
<p>A list of classes is available at <a href="http://csusummerarts.org" rel="nofollow">csusummerarts.org</a>.
The schedule of public performances will be announced in late
May.</p>

President&#x2019;s Speaker Series helps Monterey County flourish</h3>
<p>With a theme of &#x201C;Flourish Monterey County,&#x201D;
this year&#x2019;s President&#x2019;s Speaker Series at CSU Monterey Bay provided
fresh insights into the challenges faced by local communities.</p>
<p>The series opened March 4 with a presentation by Mary Jo Waits,
director of the Economic, Human Services and Workforce Division of
the National Governors Association. Her topic was &#x201C;Leveraging
Universities in Regional Economic Development.&#x201D;</p>
<p>David Kennedy, former director of the Boston Gun Project,
followed with a March 28 talk on &#x201C;Gangs, Guns and Growth: Finding
Alternatives to Violence.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jeff Edmondson, managing director of Strive Together, spoke
April 9 on &#x201C;Collective Impact: A New Way of Doing Business to
Improve Educational Outcomes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The theme of next spring&#x2019;s series will be &#x201C;Future Monterey.&#x201D;
Speakers will examine how the county&#x2019;s economy can be diversified
beyond agriculture and tourism.</p>

CalStateTEACH pairs first-graders with teacher candidates</h3>
<p>Each June for the past four years, 20
first-grade students from Highland Elementary have joined with 20
teaching credential candidates from Cal StateTEACH in a unique
summer tutorial endeavor at King Elementary School in Seaside.</p>
<p>The Summer Literacy Lab School Partnership provides invaluable
instruction for students not making adequate progress during the
regular academic year, as well as high-quality mentoring for the
teacher candidates tutoring them. The 16-day program is a
partnership between CalStateTEACH and Monterey Peninsula Unified
School District.</p>
<p>The mostly limited-English-speaking students receive one-on-one
support in reading and language arts. The tutors first administer
assessments from CalStateTEACH&#x2019;s Literacy Case Study, then design
instruction to close the literacy gap.</p>
<p>Roger Dahl, the CSUMB lecturer who designed and leads the
CalStateTEACH program, worked with MPUSD personnel to address the
need for focused instruction for the English-learner
population.</p>
<p>During the summer program, the student teachers receive daily
mentoring from two literacy experts from MPUSD, who provide
guidance on the best strategies and practices and offer immediate
feedback.</p>
<p>Results from the first four summers have been impressive, with
students in many cases making progress equal to what they achieved
during the school year in only three weeks of focused
instruction.</p>
