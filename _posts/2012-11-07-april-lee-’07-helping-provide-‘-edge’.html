<p>In a previous life, April Lee was an air traffic controller in
the Air Force, guiding multiple planes down for a safe landing.
Now, in the CSUMB President&#x2019;s Office, she guides important projects
and deadlines behind the scenes &#x2013; not often visible, but critical
to the university&#x2019;s operation.</p>
<p>The CSUMB alum has been giving back to her alma mater for more
than five years. &#x201C;I chose to support CSUMB because I truly believe
in education&#x201D; said April, a re-entry student and mother of two. &#x201C;I
want to help anyone I can to &#x2018;have that edge.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>April attributes her success to the many people who make up the
CSUMB family. In particular, she singled out three professors,
Jeffrey Froshman, Pat Tinsley and the late Jay Foss, who were all
critical to her achieving a major milestone in her life &#x2013; attaining
her bachelor&#x2019;s degree.</p>
<p>According to April, she couldn&#x2019;t have done it without the
support of her husband and two boys. &#x201C;I wanted to show my sons an
example of the benefits of completing your education and then
giving back.&#x201D; Her shining example is already paying off &#x2014; her elder
son is now a senior at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.<br>
