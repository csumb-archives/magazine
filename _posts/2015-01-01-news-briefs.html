<p>When graduates cross the stage at commencement next May, they will join not only the Class of 2015, but also The Class of  3 Million – three million graduates of the California State University system.</p>
<p>It’s one of the largest alumni networks in the world.</p>
<p>To mark this milestone, 2015 graduates as well as alumni from all 23 CSU campuses are invited to "sign" The Class of  3 Million Yearbook. The online yearbook is a way for CSU alums to connect and build relationships with one another.</p>
<p>Everyone who signs the yearbook will be entered to win one of three $10,000 scholarships for a current or future student. All 2015 grads will receive Class of 3 Million silicone wristbands in time for commencement ceremonies.</p>
<p>Sign the yearbook at Classof3Million.calstate.edu.</p>

<p>Cal State Monterey Bay Professor Doug Smith and graduate student Sam Phillips are collaborating with federal and state resource agencies to develop the Big Sur River Watershed Management Plan. The plan summarizes the environmental condition of the watershed and details the steps that residents and resource managers can take to sustain the local salmon population.</p>
<p>The Big Sur River and other ecologically critical streams and wetlands are constantly threatened by human activities that alter how water flows over and through the landscape. Urbanization and agricultural impacts are the leading cause of declining salmon populations along California’s Central Coast. While some impacts are inevitable, they can be markedly reduced or avoided through thoughtful and well-considered planning.</p>
<p>Resource managers can use the Big Sur management plan to apply for state and federal funding to make improvements that will help this important species thrive far into the future. Phillips used a wide range of cutting-edge tools in the project. The internship experience helped him land a position as a Fish Habitat Specialist with Eco Logical Research, Inc.</p>

<p>With a $320,000 grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and help from several partners, Professor James Lindholm will study how the impact of traditional trawling on the seafloor may be reduced by using modified gear.</p>
<p>In traditional bottom trawling, large nets are dragged across the seafloor, altering fish habitats that occur there.  Dr. Lindholm’s study will compare the impacts of traditional gear to newly modified gear that significantly reduces contact with the seafloor.</p>
<p>The project will start next summer off Half Moon Bay. "We hope the study will yield insights that result in changes in fishing behavior," Dr. Lindholm said.The project is a collaborative effort among CSUMB, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and fisherman Giovanni Pennisi.</p>

<p>In partnership with KCBA Fox 35, the university is producing a weekly television program, "Campus to Community." It’s part of CSUMB’s commitment to serving as a catalyst for positive change – through education, outreach and public service.</p>
<p>The show highlights speakers and issues of interest to the Central Coast. Students, alumni, faculty and staff are involved in the production of the program. Some installments feature one speaker, others are a magazine format with short segments highlighting various programs and professors.</p>
<p>The hour-long show started in early October and airs every Sunday at 8 a.m.</p>
<p>KCBA can be found on channel 3 on Comcast and on channel 35.1 on the campus cable system.</p>
