<p>In August, six graduates from the Japanese
Language and Culture program headed overseas as participants in the
Japanese Exchange and Teaching program, better known as JET.</p>
<p>Salinas native Salvador Nava &#x2019;13 was among them. He went to the
town of Itakuura-Machi, located in the Gunma province, where he is
teaching English to Japanese schoolchildren and serving as a bridge
between Japanese and American cultures. This rural experience is a
bit different from the last time he lived in Japan. Nava studied
abroad at Toyo University in Tokyo from September 2011 to August
2012. He describes his new home as &#x201C;really small. Like, really
really small. There are a lot of fields, and a lot of bugs.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The goal of the JET program is to promote mutual understanding
between nations. Participants work either as language teachers in
schools or in cultural relations roles at local government offices.
The initial placement is for one year, though it can be renewed for
up to five years. Placements are competitive &#x2013; the program accepts
just a third of those who apply, with about 4,300 total
participants from 45 countries.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the Japanese Language and Culture program at CSUMB, we are
fortunate to be able to send 66 percent or more of our applicants
to the JET program every year,&#x201D; said Dr. Shigeko Sekine, associate
professor in the School of World Languages and Cultures.</p>
<p>Julia Caron &#x2019;08 spent two years in the program following her
graduation from the World Languages and Cultures program with an
emphasis in Japanese. &#x201C;Studying Japanese at CSUMB made my life in
Japan a lot easier. I already had basic [language] skills to build
upon. Professors Yoshiko Saito-Abbott and Shigeko Sekine really
helped me gain a greater understanding of the culture behind the
language, which made acclimating a lot easier,&#x201D; said Caron.</p>
<p>Caron grew up in Salinas. During her time in JET, she lived in
the city of Hioki in Kagoshima prefecture.</p>
<p class="pullquote">&#x201C;I was excited to live in Kagoshima because
Salinas&#x2019; sister city, Ichikiushikino, is also in Kagoshima ...&quot;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was excited to live in Kagoshima because Salinas&#x2019; sister
city, Ichikiushikino, is also in Kagoshima and I&#x2019;d been there
before on a student exchange in high school,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Caron developed a passion for Japanese dance and music while
abroad. She took up the shinobue, a Japanese flute, and shamisen, a
three-stringed instrument similar to a banjo, as well as a form of
dance called Nihon-buyo.</p>
<p>Upon her return to the United States, she attended graduate
school at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. She
earned her master&#x2019;s in international policy studies with
concentrations in conflict resolution and Japanese in 2012.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I benefitted a lot from JET. It gave me the confidence to
continue my education,&#x201D; Caron said. &#x201C;It was fun to interact with
the students and I was satisfied to find that I really helped some
students become interested in studying English.&#x201D;</p>
