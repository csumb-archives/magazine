<h5>Innovative professors turn teaching upside down</h5>
<p>When students head to some classes at CSU Monterey Bay, they&#x2019;ve
already learned the day&#x2019;s lesson &#x2013; by watching online videos
prepared by the instructor.</p>
<p> Without a lecture to listen to, students
spend class time working in small groups, solving problems with the
help of the faculty member.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s a technology-driven teaching method known as the &#x201C;inverted
classroom&#x201D; because it flips the traditional model of classroom
lecture and exercises for homework &#x2013; the lecture becomes homework
and class time is used for problem-solving.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s a model that is gaining in popularity on campuses
nationwide. When CSUMB faculty members were recently asked to
submit proposals to promote innovation in teaching and learning,
many of the submissions came from instructors interested in
flipping their classrooms.</p>
<p>Dr. Kate Lockwood, a professor of computer science and
information technology, uses the method in programming classes, a
discipline where students learn best by doing, she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In a traditional model, I lecture at them and then send them
home to wrestle with how to apply the material on their own,&#x201D; Dr.
Lockwood said. &#x201C;As a result, many students get frustrated.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In her inverted classroom, students complete an online workbook
&#x2013; which includes videos, text and short exercises &#x2013; before coming
to class.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When they get into the classroom, we jump right in and start
exploring how to apply the material to new problems.&#x201D;</p>
<p>An added benefit: Dr. Lockwood created the workbooks and makes
them available for free, saving students the expense of a $100-plus
textbook.</p>
<p>Dr. Rachel Esselstein has used the method in her math classes
for several years and has worked to convince other faculty members
to adopt it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The inverted classroom supports the notion that instructors are
more than just lecturing machines,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;We can share our
passions and excitement for the material when we are allowed to
interact with the students rather than just lecture at them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Both professors say students enjoy the inverted classroom once
they get the hang of it. At first, many students are uncomfortable
learning from a video but they change their minds when they realize
they can pause the video, rewind and replay it as many times as
they need to.</p>
<p>It also prompts students to come to class prepared. Students
can&#x2019;t participate without having watched the video lecture.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Their peers and the instructor hold these students accountable
for keeping up in a way that is not possible in a traditional
classroom,&#x201D; Dr. Esselstein said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lecturing is a basic cognitive skill for a student. All they&#x2019;re
doing is taking in information, writing notes and maybe asking
questions,&#x201D; said Esselstein, who introduced the new model to the
university in 2010.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We send them home to do homework because we&#x2019;re asking them to
apply the knowledge. This is the time that they need the support of
a teacher.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Esselstein was inspired to flip her classroom by the success of
the Khan Academy, which provides free online video tutorials on a
variety of topics.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I try to convince them that it&#x2019;s better than class, because
they can pause it, they can watch it as many times as they want,&#x201D;
Esselstein said.&#xA0;</p>
