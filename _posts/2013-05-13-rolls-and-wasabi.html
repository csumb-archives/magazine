<p>Check out the desk of the future. Nicknamed the &#x201C;wasabi&#x201D; or
&#x201C;bumper car&#x201D; chairs, these eye-popping green desks debuted in one
of the classrooms in the Media Learning Center last fall.</p>
<p>Unlike the typical stationary desks that wind up arranged in
rows, these desks are on rollers, which allow students and
instructors to arrange them to suit the day&#x2019;s activity &#x2013; whether
that is paired up, in small groups or with the entire class.</p>
<p>Natasha Oehlman and David Calloway have found the mobility
particularly useful in a class they team-teach, CHHS 125: Writing
as Healing. &#x201C;David takes half the class and I take the other half
and we work in smaller pods,&#x201D; Oehlman says. &#x201C;The space and
furniture have allowed us to be more versatile in our teach- ing
and instruction, but more importantly have allowed our students to
move around and engage in the curriculum using their bodies &#x2013; as
well as their minds.</p>
<p>&#x201C;One student last semester asked if there were &#x2018;more courses
like this one that get us moving around and working together...I am
always sitting in class being talked at.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>The desks come equipped with cup holders and under-seat baskets
for stu- dents to store their books and bags.</p>
<p>In addition to the brightly colored desks,
the room has two stationery Smartboards and two 70-inch mobile
touch-screens and a mobile teach- ing podium. It&#x2019;s a model for the
type of innovative, technologically&#xA0;savvy instruction CSUMB
aspires to.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Everything is flexible for whatever the class agenda
presents,&#x201D;&#xA0;says Denise Castro, who teaches a class on nursing
leadership and management in the room. &#x201C;I also love the touch
screen features.</p>
<p>The other evening the students were giving a presentation and to
advance their&#xA0;Prezi they physically&#xA0;clicked or dragged to
move the&#xA0;content with their whole body. It allows them to
really connect and&#xA0;interact with the technology.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Center for Academic Technologies collaborated closely
with&#xA0;Dr. Kate Lockwood, chair of the Faculty Senate Technology
Committee, to research and review the new technology and classroom
design. Based on the feedback they&#x2019;ve received from
faculty&#xA0;members and students, they&#x2019;ve submitted a proposal to
university leadership to&#xA0;transform an additional six to 10
learning spaces over the next 18 months.</p>
