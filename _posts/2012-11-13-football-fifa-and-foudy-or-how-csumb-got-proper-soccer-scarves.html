<p>By Kevin Gilmore</p>
<p>Back in January, a soccer ball with a British accent began
tweeting about being the biggest supporter of &#x201C;proper football&#x201D; at
CSUMB under the handle <a href="https://twitter.com/CSUMBfooty" rel="nofollow">@CSUMBfooty</a>. The erudite ball called CSUMB men&#x2019;s
and women&#x2019;s soccer &#x201C;the best game in town&#x201D; and bemoaned the lack of
&#x201C;proper soccer scarves&#x201D; in the greater Monterey Bay area.</p>
<p>The sassy tweets continued for months with quips such as &#x201C;It&#x2019;s
been spring break here at&#xA0;CSUMB, so Pitch is sunning himself,
Post and Crossbar are playing Jenga, but Stands? He just sits
there.&#x201D; Footy&#x2019;s following grew slowly but steadily. Until April 1,
that is.</p>
<p>On that foolish holiday, Otter Athletics sent out a <a href="http://www.otterathletics.com/news/2012/3/29/GEN_0329122306.aspx" rel="nofollow">phony press release and staged a press
conference</a> announcing long-time CSUMB staff member Greg Pool
was being indicted on 41 FIFA charges (FIFA is the international
governing body for soccer) the most egregious of which was &#x201C;gross
anthropomorphism&#x201D; as the result of impersonating a loquacious
leather orb.</p>
<p>A companion press release gave subtle clues as to the true
nature of the event.<br>
Assistant Athletic Director Kirby Garry piled on, tweeting, &#x201C;For us
to do nothing would have risked the integrity
of&#xA0;CSUMB&#xA0;and our soccer programs&#x201D; and linking to the
fictional press release. This tweet was picked up by Kevin DeShazo
of Field House Media and former CNBC sports reporter Darren Rovell,
who retweeted the story to their 1,400 and 197,000 followers,
respectively. Later in the day, former U.S. national team soccer
legend and ESPN analyst Julie Foudy (18,000 followers) asked on
Twitter for any good April Fools jokes. Pool responded to Foudy
with news of the prank. She replied, &#x201C;Hysterical!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Otter Athletics crew took advantage of the buzz to make
Footy&#x2019;s wish for proper soccer scarves come true. They designed a
scarf that serves as fundraiser, souvenir and season ticket to
every home game. Ten days before the conference opener on Sept. 7,
they had sold out of the first run, raising $1,725 that will go to
scholarships for student-athletes.</p>
<p>Upon delivering one of the scarves to University Police Officer
Joseph Prebula, Pool/Footy received yet another citation, this time
for &#x201C;excessive awesome.&#x201D;</p>

<h4>JUST WHO IS @CSUMBFOOTY ANYWAYS?</h4>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/csumbfooty" rel="nofollow">@CSUMBFooty</a> represents the kind of football fan one
might encounter at a pub outside of London. Lively and clever, he&#x2019;s
also full of mischief.</p>
<h6>When did you first learn you were anthropomorphic?</h6>
<p>That&#x2019;s a bit offensive, don&#x2019;t you think? I mean, when did you
first learn you were anthropological?</p>
<h6>What prompted you to throw your anthropomorphism in FIFA&#x2019;s
face?</h6>
<p>FIFA? They&#x2019;re a nasty bit o&#x2019; work, those muppets. Me and my kind
have been kicked around by those blokes for decades. I&#x2019;m not
losing&#xA0;stitches&#xA0;over it.</p>
<h6>Many felt it was a pretty dicey proposition to take on FIFA the
way you did. While Otter soccer got in hot water, you came out of
it with your reputation still intact. How did you pull off that
magic act?</h6>
<p>Listen, it&#x2019;s not like I made a shameful meal of it. We knew
exactly what we were up to, and if it meant raising awareness of
proper football in Monterey County, so be it. What more can you ask
of a ball?</p>
<h6>We now know that your courageous act of civil disobedience
served to draw attention to the lack of a proper scarf in the
Monterey Bay area. What was the genesis of your plan?</h6>
<p>It&#x2019;s bloody cold by the sea, mate! Have you been to those late
games when the fog rolls in off the Pacific? But really, I&#x2019;m trying
to create a football culture here. Scarves are only the first step.
Wait &#x2018;til you hear us chant!<br>
