<p>CSU Monterey Bay was honored for its contribution to the
economic vitality, growth and preservation of the area at the Feb.
4 anniversary gala of the Monterey County Business Council.</p>
<p>The university, one of six organizations to be honored in key
industry clusters, was recognized for education and research.</p>
<p>The university leads the transformation of Fort Ord. The economy
has delayed several projects on the former Army base, but the
university has continued to move ahead &#x2013; in enrollment, employment,
facilities and housing.</p>
<p>With a payroll of nearly 900, the university is one of the
county&#x2019;s 20 largest employers and a key player in its vital
economic sector of higher education. Its annual financial impact of
$270 million sustains an additional 1,400 jobs.</p>

Harrison shows off an MCBC Economic Vitality Award presented to
CSUMB.</p>
