researched freshwater cyanobacterial algal blooms in the Monterey
Bay area. Mentored by Dr. Susan Alexander, Ross investigated
whether seabirds use smell to assess mate compatibility. Davis

Institute for Marine Science in the Bahamas, mentored by Dr. Rikk
Kvitek.</p>
<p>Rubio is headed to the University of Wisconsin or Oregon State;
Ross will attend the University of Wisconsin; Davis is choosing
between Oregon State University and the Virginia Institute of
Marine Science; and Johnson is going to the University of
