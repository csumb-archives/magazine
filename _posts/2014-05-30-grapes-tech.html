<h3>Alumni use skills learned at CSUMB for &#x2018;precision
viticulture&#x2019;</h3>
<p class="small">By PATIA STEPHENS</p>
<p class="intro">Gregory Gonzalez (SBS &#x2019;09) and Jonathan Vevoda
(SBS &#x2019;12) launched their careers at CSU Monterey Bay. The two
alumni use geographic information systems (GIS) skills they learned
at CSUMB in their jobs at Scheid Vineyards.</p>
<p>A world-class winery headquartered in
Greenfield, Scheid Vineyards comprises 13 ranches with 4,200 acres
producing 38,000 tons of grapes a year &#x2013; resulting in some 40
million gallons of wine.</p>
<p>Gonzalez and Vevoda, with their boss Tyler Scheid, are at the
forefront of the emerging &#x201C;precision viticulture&#x201D; industry, in
which GIS and other high-tech tools turn the art of winemaking into
a profitable &#x2013; and palatable &#x2013; science.</p>
<p>Both majored in Social and Behavioral Sciences and started at
Scheid as interns, becoming full-time employees after
graduation.</p>
<p>Gonzalez came to CSUMB as a soccer player transferring from
Oregon. He turned to GIS after receiving some good advising.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sharon Anderson emailed me and said, if you take one more
class, you can get a minor in Environmental Science,&#x201D; Gonzalez
said.</p>
<p>He started at Scheid in 2009, using global positioning systems
(GPS) and GIS to remap boundaries, label &#x201C;blocks&#x201D; of vines and
estimate crop yields.</p>
<p>A Salinas High School graduate, Vevoda earned a concentration in
GIS after his research revealed it was one of the top emerging
career paths. GIS combines his interests in the outdoors, maps and
technology.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a good balance between working on computers and working in
the field,&#x201D; Vevoda said.</p>
<p>His first project for Scheid &#x2013; also his senior capstone project
&#x2013; was developing a harvest safety rating system, the first of its
kind. The program measures and rates slopes, which helps the winery
prevent accidents by allocating more experienced personnel to
steeper sections. Identifying slope, along with aspect (slope
direction) and solar radiation, also helps with vineyard site
selection.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I can look at a location and tell whether this lot will get
fruit ripe when we need it to be,&#x201D; Vevoda said. &#x201C;If we can see it&#x2019;s
going to be in shade by 2 o&#x2019;clock, it&#x2019;s probably not a good place
to plant vines.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Efficiency is the goal of precision viticulture, Gonzalez
said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s amazing what you can do with a smartphone,&#x201D; Gonzalez said.
&#x201C;We&#x2019;re all engineers. Farmers are engineers. We&#x2019;re turning data
into information you can act on.&#x201D; <strong>MB</strong></p>
