<p><strong>Explain what your business
is/does?</strong></p>
<p>J&amp;P Organics grows organic vegetables and fruits, packs, and
delivers boxes with fresh vegetables and fruits to people&#x2019;s homes
in the Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, and Monterey Counties.</p>
<p><strong>When did you start it?</strong></p>
<p>We started in Spring of 2006</p>
<p><strong>Why did you start it?</strong></p>
<p>My family had farmed raspberries and flowers in the past but due
to conditions out of our control my parents had to take regular
jobs in nurseries. I had the opportunity to come to college and
study environmental science. Luck would have it that I became
interested in organic farming after learning and seeing the
negative effects of pesticides on the environment and our bodies.
Since my family has a background in farming It just seemed like the
right path to take.</p>
<p><strong>How did the recession affect you and your
business?</strong></p>
<p>We luckily just saw small growth but any growth is good
growth.</p>
<p><strong>What do you like about your work?</strong></p>
<p>Everything! I like the farming aspect, I like the packing with
my brother listening to music, driving my van while eating a basket
full of organic strawberries, delivering to people&#x2019;s houses (even
if I have to run away from dogs)... Everyday is different.</p>
<p><strong>What are the challenges?</strong></p>
<p>The weather! If it&#x2019;s too hot the sun damages certain fruits and
veggies, if it&#x2019;s too cold produce doesn&#x2019;t grow, if it rains
strawberries go bad, if it doesn&#x2019;t rain we suffer the drought
economically, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How did your CSUMB education prepare you?</strong></p>
<p>CSUMB was the key element to our decision to grow organic. ESSP
lead us to a more sustainable and earth friendly way of growing
produce. Gave me the knowledge to make decisions while taking all
parties that may be affected into consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any advice for others who may be considering
starting a business?</strong></p>
<p>Networking! I have had the immense fortune to meet great people
who know other great people that have helped us grow.</p>
<p><strong>Anything else you&apos;d like to add?</strong></p>
<p>You may hate your professors for a little while, especially when
they make you write and re-write, add and divide, but in the end it
all comes together and creates a more well-rounded and
knowledgeable person -- and you remember them fondly as the years
go by.</p>
