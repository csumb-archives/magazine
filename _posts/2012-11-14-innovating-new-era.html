<h5>President Ochoa sees the university poised to present
ground-breaking solutions to the challenges facing higher ed</h5>
<p>By James Tinney</p>
<p>Eduardo M. Ochoa has taken a circuitous route to his new
position as interim president at Cal State Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>It may just be, however, that he has arrived in exactly the
right place at the right time to make a difference both at his new
university and in the future course of higher education.</p>
<p>Ochoa, 61, comes to CSUMB after a varied career, during which he
has earned degrees at Reed College, Columbia University and the New
School for Social Research in disciplines including physics and
philosophy, nuclear engineering and economics. He has worked in the
Cal State system as a faculty member and administrator for 29
years, and most recently served as assistant secretary for
postsecondary education in the Obama Administration.</p>
<p>That wide-ranging experience has convinced Ochoa that colleges
and universities must do things differently in an era of shrinking
resources and growing demand for college graduates.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We need a new model for higher education, one that has a lower
cost structure while maintaining or improving outcomes. That is the
outstanding issue for higher education nationally,&#x201D; Ochoa
said.<br>
At Cal State Monterey Bay, Ochoa is leading a young institution,
begun by education innovators. He said that CSUMB&#x2019;s focus on
learning outcomes &#x2013; structuring classes around specific goals of
what students are expected to learn &#x2013; positions the university well
to be a leader in this new educational era.</p>
<p>By remaining focused on specified learning outcomes, Ochoa said,
the university can experiment with how to structure classes most
efficiently to achieve those goals.<br>
Ochoa said the traditional lecture-based teaching model has changed
little since the days that monks or other religious leaders stood
behind a lectern and read documents to a mostly illiterate
audience.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s just not the world we are operating in now,&#x201D; Ochoa
said.</p>
<p>Today, seemingly unlimited information is just a Google search
away. The challenge lies not so much in gathering data, but in
evaluating it critically. Students also need to learn the skills of
working across disciplines and in teams to prepare them for the
modern workplace.</p>
<p>He believes that advances in the cognitive sciences &#x2013; how people
think and learn &#x2013; are opening up new strategies toward more
effective teaching.</p>
<p>During his time in Washington, D.C., Ochoa discussed this topic
with Carl Wieman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and
administration science advisor. Wieman&#x2019;s data-driven research
indicates students only retain the first 10 minutes or so of a
lecture in short-term memory. In his study, teachers who had
students participate in hands-on exercises every 10 minutes
produced far better learning outcomes than those who simply
lectured straight through.</p>
<p>Ochoa is also interested in the idea of &#x201C;flipping the
classroom,&#x201D; a new approach that is already being tried by a few Cal
State Monterey Bay faculty members. That means streaming lectures
online so students can watch &#x2013; and perhaps re-watch confusing parts
&#x2013; at home. Then, class time can be used for group discussion and
interaction with faculty to deepen understanding of the
material.<br>
Similarly, Ochoa sees the wise use of information technology
freeing up faculty members from routine tasks and giving them more
time for high quality interaction with students.</p>
<p>Ochoa draws from many years of experience as both a faculty
member and administrator in helping plot the future of CSUMB. He
was a lecturer in economics at Fresno State University for three
years, then became a tenured professor at Cal State Los Angeles
from 1984 to 1997, where he served in a number of additional roles.
He was dean of the College of Business Administration at Cal Poly
Pomona from 1997-2003, and provost and vice president for academic
affairs at Sonoma State from 2003-2010.</p>
<p>While at Sonoma, he worked with President Ruben Armi&#xF1;ana, one of
the CSU&#x2019;s longest-tenured presidents.<br>
&#x201C;Eduardo is a higher education leader whose experience, training
and vision make him a perfect president for CSUMB. We worked very
closely while he was Sonoma State&#x2019;s provost and vice president for
Academic Affairs and he provided exceptional academic leadership to
the university before leaving for the U.S. Department of Education,
where he provided that kind of academic leadership at the national
level,&#x201D; Armi&#xF1;ana said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He works hard in making the future of higher education better
in quality and efficiency. I value him as a friend and
colleague.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ochoa describes his two years in the Obama Administration as a
&#x201C;once-in-a-lifetime experience,&#x201D; but acknowledges that dealing with
the partisan gridlock and bureaucratic politics in Washington,
D.C., wasn&#x2019;t the best fit for his personality. He points out with a
measure of pride, however, that his two years as assistant
secretary exceeded the average tenure of 18 months in the
position.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Leading a university that serves a diverse student body and
maintains a broad focus seems to be a better position for a man
whose life story is an interesting take on the American Dream.</p>
<p>Ochoa grew up in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he attended a
bilingual school. His father worked for a U.S.-based pharmaceutical
firm, and, after attending a conference hosted by the company in
the U.S., he had hoped to move his family to this country. When a
transfer was not forthcoming, he contacted an employment agency,
received about 100 job leads, left his two sons and his pregnant
wife in Argentina, bought a Greyhound bus pass and spent months
criss-crossing the country looking for work.</p>
<p>A biochemist, he was hired to run the clinical lab at Portland&#x2019;s
Good Samaritan Hospital, and then brought his family to join
him.</p>
<p>In a commencement speech this spring at Cal State Los Angeles,
Ochoa told the students of his personal journey and the role that
education has played in his life.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It led me to serial careers as an engineer, professor and
administrator, and, two years ago, to being appointed by President
Obama as assistant secretary for post-secondary education,&#x201D; Ochoa
said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is a testimony to this country that this could happen to a
14-year-old immigrant boy. But it is also a testimony to the power
of education.&#x201D;</p>
