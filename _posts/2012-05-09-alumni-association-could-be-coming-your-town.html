<p>Stay tuned, because there could be a CSU Monterey Bay Alumni
Association event coming to your town soon.</p>
<p>After years of focusing its programs and events primarily on the
Monterey Bay region, the association has begun reaching out more
actively to alumni throughout California and across the
country.</p>
<p>That change was evident this winter in the association&#x2013;sponsored
Alumni Mixers, held Feb. 23 in Sacramento and March 24 in Long
Beach. CSUMB alumni also gathered in late February in New York City
and Washington, D.C., to participate in CSU alumni receptions,
attended by President Dianne Harrison.</p>
<p>It is especially important for all alumni to make sure the
association has their current address so they can be alerted when
events and programs are being planned in their area. Facebook,
LinkedIn, and Twitter are other good way to stay connected.</p>
<p>Networking is one obvious payoff from more regional alumni
awareness, as well as sharing pride in CSUMB. Once an Otter, always
an Otter!</p>
