<p class="intro">Once again, we&#x2019;re hearing calls for a
heart-to-heart about race and racism.</p>
<p class="intro">In 1997, President Clinton began a discussion on
the topic by appointing an advisory board. In 2008, presidential
candidate Barack Obama urged citizens to move beyond treating race
as a spectacle. Less than a year later, Attorney General Eric
Holder called the United States &#x201C;a nation of cowards&#x201D; because we do
not confront issues of race and racism openly and honestly.</p>
<p class="intro">Now, in the wake of Trayvon Martin&#x2019;s death and
George Zimmerman&#x2019;s subsequent trial, Associate Professor for the
Division of Humanities and Communication John Berteaux offers his
insights.</p>
<p><strong>Is racism a phenomenon of individuals
or institutions or both?</strong></p>
<p>While individuals may recognize that racism exists, they
disagree about what it is. For some, any differentiation between
persons on the basis of race is racist; racism is just differential
treatment. Or is it a matter of one individual not liking or
mistreating another on the basis of race prejudice? To determine
whether an act is racist or not, should we look at the intentions
or the effects? Does racial discrimination always have to be
intentional, or are there cases in which individuals or communities
are unconscious of their racist perceptions and actions?</p>
<p>How one answers these questions makes a big difference. For
example, if racism is simply personal bias, then we can help
individuals see their racism and overcome it. Or I might, on a
personal basis, want to deal with my own racism. But if racism is
in fact a product of educational, legal, economic and other
institutions, then addressing the problem at the level of the
individual is likely to prove insufficient.</p>
<p><strong>I&#x2019;m not a racist &#x2013; am I?</strong></p>
<p>Given that our mental lives are not fully transparent to
conscious thought &#x2013; that it is impossible to look inward,
critically reflect and grasp with complete accuracy all the grounds
for our thoughts, words or actions &#x2013; is it possible to possess the
legitimacy or moral authority to determine what is impartial or
just? Not only am I not fully transparent to myself, the minds of
others are especially mysterious. Neuroscientist and philosopher
Antonio Damasio notes accordingly that we cannot observe the minds
of others and only observe our own minds through a very narrow
window.</p>
<p><strong>How do race and racism function?</strong></p>
<p>I am reminded of a line from the movie &#x201C;Death and the Maiden.&#x201D;
You may remember the scene in which Sigourney Weaver&#x2019;s husband
interrogates her. Again and again he insists that she explain why
she didn&#x2019;t tell him she was raped while in custody in Argentina&#x2019;s
&#x201C;dirty war.&#x201D; Finally, in frustration, she blurts out, &#x201C;There is a
difference between hearing the facts and knowing the details.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I took her to mean that while she could give him the facts, it
was details that rendered what happened to her real and he could
never absorb the depth of her experiences &#x2013; the details. I think
race, gender, disability and sexuality all work in this way. They
can injure the individual in a myriad of ways (i.e.,
psychologically, socially and economically). But cognitive
awareness of these facts falls far<br>
short of deep personal understanding, either of the roots, the
nature, or the consequences of the individual&#x2019;s experience.</p>
<p><strong>So is any conversation about race and racism a waste of
time?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe before we start talking about race and racism, what is
needed is a heart-to-heart about the underlying assumptions and
beliefs that frame our interactions. We assume a lot any time we
engage with one another, but especially when we get involved in
difficult conversations about controversial topics. Are we all
talking about the same thing? Often, we find we aren&#x2019;t.&#xA0;</p>
