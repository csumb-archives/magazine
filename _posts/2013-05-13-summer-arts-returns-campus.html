<p>After an exciting debut in 2012, CSU Summer Arts returns to
campus in July with a lineup of 17 classes and 52 public
events.</p>
<p>Students &#x2013; who come from CSU campuses, other four-year and
two-year colleges as well as the local community &#x2013; are immersed in
rigorous training 12&#xA0;hours a day during the two-week sessions.
Classes will be offered in dance, music, theater, creative writing,
visual arts, filmmaking and animation.</p>
<p>The guest artists/teachers include actors from the Steppenwolf
Theatre Company; Eliot Fisk, who will be among the classical guitar
instructors; and profession- als from DreamWorks, who will lead the
animation session.</p>
<p>The public events include lectures, concerts and theatrical
productions, all priced to make them ac- cessible to a wide
audience. In addition, each course offers a free public performance
or &#x201C;culmination&#x201D; at the end of the session where students showcase
their talents.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The most exciting part of Summer Arts is that there will be so
many exceptional arts events taking place in our own backyard,&#x201D;
said Rob Klevan, the program&#x2019;s community relations specialist.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are here to ignite artful minds. The community is invited to
come and enjoy 28 days of eclectic art-making,&#x201D; added Rachel Nardo,
director of CSU Summer Arts.</p>
<p>A list of classes is available at csusummerarts.org. The
schedule of public performances will be announced in late May.</p>
