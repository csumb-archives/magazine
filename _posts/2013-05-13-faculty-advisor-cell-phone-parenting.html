<p class="intro">Most teenagers have cell phones these days,
and parenting is changing as a result. We asked CSUMB Professor of
Human Development Rob Weisskirch how cell phone use affects the
dynamic of the parent-child relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Poor communication is a common complaint when it comes
to parents and teenagers. What happens when you throw a cell phone
into the mix?</strong></p>
<p>Don&apos;t &quot;throw&quot; a cell phone into the mix. Parents may assume that
teens know the expectations of behavior when parents give them a
cell phone, but, as growing teens, they need to know what the
expectations are of having a cell phone. And, they need to be
reminded.</p>
<p>Teens are not always good at recognizing and predicting the
outcomes of their behavior, so parents need to be the ones to spell
out the consequences. A parent might say at the outset that the
child must respond to text messages or voicemails within a half
hour or cell phone privileges will be suspended. Parents may also
need to remind teens about unacceptable behaviors such as
cyberbullying or sending and receiving sexually suggestive images
or text.</p>
<p><strong>Is it an overstatement to say that parenting is changing
as a consequence of cell phone use?&#x2028;</strong></p>
<p>Yes and no. No, in that parents still have to provide good
guidance, discipline and support. Nothing substitutes for good
parenting. Yes, in that teens have more access to the outside world
without the filter of parents, so parents have to work harder to
have kids disclose what is happening in their cyber world as well
as their everyday lives.&#x2028;&#x2028;Parents who foster a good relationship
with their teens, in general, will be able to use the cell phone to
extend their relationship, stay informed and support one another.
Parents should not anticipate better tracking and connecting with
their teens just because they have a cell phone. Parents should
also not assume kids will be safer going into risky situations
because &quot;they can always call.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Does it matter who initiates the call &#x2013; the parent or
the child?</strong></p>
<p>My research has indicated that there are more positive outcomes
when the child initiates the communication. A teen initiating
communication with a parent may be demonstrating a better overall
relationship in that he or she is reaching out to the parent. It
may seem intuitive, but when teens call seeking social support or
asking advice or permission, they report that parental knowledge
about what is happening in their lives increases. When teens report
that parents regularly call when upset, parents know less. Parents
calling when upset, in particular, has been associated with lower
self-esteem for both teens and their parents.</p>
<p><strong>How can parents minimize conflict over
the issue?</strong></p>
<p>Parents should tell their teens of their expectations and norms
of behavior about owning a cell phone and what the consequences
will be of violating those expectations and norms, and of course,
follow through with those consequences. Despite the potential
protests, I believe strongly that teens will survive without cell
phones for a day or more. Given the merging of technologies like
the cell phone, computers, video game consoles and the Internet,
this pattern should be followed across the technologies.</p>
<p>The best advice I&#x2019;ve heard is that just like parents know their
children&apos;s face-to-face friends, they should know their &quot;virtual&quot;
friends too, including where they go and where they are hanging out
online. Separate from the issue of safety, knowing is just good
parenting. Parents know more when they foster a relationship in
which kids are willing to disclose their activities. Kids are
willing to disclose when parents communicate expectations of
behavior clearly.</p>
<p><strong>How young is too young to give a child a cell
phone?&#x2028;</strong></p>
<p>Since cell phones cost several hundred dollars, I would not want
to put something that expensive in a child&apos;s hands, unmonitored,
until they demonstrate sufficient responsibility. Some parents want
to give their child a cell phone &quot;in case of an emergency.&quot; My
larger concern is the idea that parents are permitting young
children to be somewhere where there aren&apos;t responsible adults
around to whom a child could turn in case of a problem.</p>
