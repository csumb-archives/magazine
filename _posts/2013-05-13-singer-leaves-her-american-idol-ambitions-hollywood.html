<p>A bit of encouragement from Mariah Carey
helped CSUMB student Stevie Rae Stephens land a ticket<br>
to Hollywood.</p>
<p>Stephens, a 21-year-old senior from Livermore, auditioned for
the prime-time hit program &#x201C;American Idol&#x201D; last summer in Long
Beach, one of eight sites across the country where singers tried to
earn a coveted &#x201C;golden ticket&#x201D; to the next round of
competition.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mariah ended up giving me a thumbs up offstage before my
audition and that took some of the nerves away,&#x201D; Stephens said.</p>
<p>She was one of about 300 singers &#x2013; half men, half women &#x2013; who
advanced to Hollywood. Those auditions were held in December,
during finals week at CSUMB.</p>
<p>She survived a round of solo competition, which cut the field in
half. The 75 remaining female singers were placed in groups of
three or four, and given a short period of time to prepare an
assigned song.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That was the hardest thing I&#x2019;ve had to do, but it was the best
part of the experience,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;You get your group&#x2019;s song &#x2013;
ours was &#x2018;Go Your Own Way&#x2019; by Fleetwood Mac &#x2013; at 10 p.m. and you
have to work on the harmony, lyrics and choreography by 6 a.m. If
you get an hour of sleep, you&#x2019;re lucky.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She didn&#x2019;t survive the cut to 20, but has no regrets about the
experience. &#x201C;They put a camera in your face and ask, &#x2018;How much do
you want it?,&#x2019; &#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I felt one-dimensional; I&#x2019;m not that.
I&#x2019;m more than just a singer.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think I was ready to give up my capstone presentation
and commencement,&#x201D; which the show&#x2019;s taping schedule would have
required. She&#x2019;ll graduate in May with a degree in music recording
technology and hopes to pursue a master&#x2019;s degree in electronic
music.</p>
<p>Will she continue to perform?</p>
<p>&#x201C;Always.&#x201D;</p>
