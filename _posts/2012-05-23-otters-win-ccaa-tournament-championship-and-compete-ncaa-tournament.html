<h3>&#x2018;A well-oiled machine&#x2019;</h3>
<p><strong>By Scott Faust</strong><br>
<br>
With a CCAA tournament championship in hand and a strong corps of
returning seniors, CSU Monterey Bay women&#x2019;s basketball coach Renee
Jimenez has plenty of reasons to be optimistic about next year.</p>
<p>But she sees an even bigger picture, an arc of progress for a
program &#x2013; indeed for all of Otter athletics &#x2013; that has built a
tradition of winning on hard-earned pride.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The biggest thing was changing the culture to &#x2018;it&#x2019;s not OK to
lose,&#x2019;&#x201D; said Jimenez, who completed her fourth season with an
injury-plagued 21-9 record, a top-25 Division II ranking and a
first-round loss in the NCAA West Regional tournament.</p>
<p>The team also had its highest-ever combined GPA &#x2013; over 3.0.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We expect to win every game,&#x201D; Jimenez said. &#x201C;We expect to win
in the classroom, and we expect to win in the community.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She credits next year&#x2019;s seniors with doing the &#x201C;hard work&#x201D; to
establish that culture.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re starting to be a well-oiled machine, where those older
guys are starting to run this program for us, which is really nice
as a coach,&#x201D; Jimenez said.</p>
<p>Five of the recruits who will help keep that machine going were
in the Otters&#x2019; &#x201C;Kelp Bed&#x201D; when CSUMB defeated CSU East Bay in the
first round of the CCAA tournament , which they went on to win
March 3 with a buzzer-beater against CSU Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The Feb. 28 sellout crowd of student &#x201C;Blue Crue&#x201D; boosters made
quite an impression on the recruits, Jimenez said.</p>
<p>Success is fostering success.</p>
<p>&#x201C;More coaches are wanting to send their kids to us,&#x201D; she said.
&#x201C;I think that&#x2019;s really a testament to what our players have done,
as well as to the strong momentum of our entire athletic
department.&#x201D;</p>
