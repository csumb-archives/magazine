<p class="fineprint">In the heart of California&#x2019;s Central Coast,
the former Fort Ord encompasses a sweeping landscape of vivid
beauty and rich natural diversity. One of the few remaining
expanses of large, contiguous open space in the increasingly
developed Monterey Bay area, this area is a rolling landscape long
treasured for recreation, scientific research, outdoor education,
and historical significance.</p>
<p class="fineprint">-- Presidential Proclamation<br>
Establishment of the Fort Ord National Monument<br>
April 20, 2012</p>
<p>The establishment of the Fort Ord National Monument was widely
hailed on the Central Coast as a boon for preservation, recreation
and tourism in the region.</p>
<p>At the Watershed Institute, on the campus of California State
University, Monterey Bay, the proclamation was viewed as another
significant step in the ongoing effort to restore an endangered
ecosystem. That effort long has involved CSU Monterey Bay students
and faculty, as well as alumni whose inspiration springs, in part,
from their days as &#x201C;Weed Warriors&#x201D; at their alma mater.</p>
<p>One of those alumni is Kevin Ghalambor.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Basically, we want to<a href="../../../../gallery/fort-ord-monument-restoration.html" rel="nofollow">take that and help it look like that</a>,&#x201D; said
Ghalambor, as he indicates a barren area of sandy soil on one hand
and a stretch of healthy coastal chaparral on the other.</p>
<p>Ghalambor is a Fort Ord Project team leader and biologist for
Burleson Consulting of Sacramento. Burleson has contracted with the
Army Corps of Engineers to restore 65 acres of land that once
served as firing ranges on the former military base.</p>
<p>For Ghalambor, this is not just another job. It is a return to
his beginnings in environmental restoration. He earned his
bachelor&#x2019;s degree in Earth Systems Science &amp; Policy at CSUMB in
fall 2001 and spent plenty of time as an undergraduate beyond the
abandoned backroads of Fort Ord.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My years at CSUMB gave me an intimate knowledge of the back
country and native plants. And that has been very helpful to me in
this project,&#x201D; Ghalambor said.</p>
<p>He also was familiar with another outstanding resource &#x2013; the
Watershed Institute at CSUMB.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The one thing I am particularly proud of is bringing in the
people at the Watershed Institute. It is not the fanciest looking
building, but I&#x2019;m very familiar with how capable they are. They
know what they are doing and have knowledge of the area that is
really unmatched,&#x201D; Ghalambor said.</p>
<p>The Watershed Institute has been involved in restoration,
education and research on Fort Ord since CSUMB&#x2019;s earliest days.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through the Weed Warriors program, the institute sends out CSUMB
students and faculty to help remove non-native plants. Through
Return of the Natives, grade school students are brought into the
backcountry to learn about native plants, invasive species and
habitat restoration.</p>
<p>Laura Lee Lienk, Watershed Institute co-director, said she is
proud of the Institute&#x2019;s long-standing effort and the role that it
played in encouraging the establishment of Fort Ord as a national
monument.</p>
<p>She said when U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar came to the
Central Coast on a fact-finding mission earlier this year, he heard
from a number of representatives who stressed the recreational uses
that could be protected through the national monument
designation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think we really brought an additional viewpoint into the
public discourse. CSUMB faculty lined up to say how students had
been engaged for years in stewardship, education and research on
this land,&#x201D; Lienk said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a student, Thor Anderson was attracted to Cal State Monterey
Bay because of its hands-on approach to environmental research.
After beginning his studies at Sacramento State, he transferred to
CSUMB, earning his bachelor&#x2019;s degree in 1999 and following up with
a master&#x2019;s in coastal and watershed science and policy in 2010.</p>
<p>Now he is a biologist for Burleson, helping to lead the Fort Ord
restoration project.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been working closely with students, really since Day One
of this project. We&#x2019;ve leaned heavily toward hiring people who have
that level of experience and familiarity with the land here, &#x201D; said
Anderson.</p>
<p>During the spring and summer, crews gather seeds from native
plants and bring them back to the greenhouses for preparation and
storage for later planting.</p>
<p>Seeds gathered during the dry months are broadcast in December
and January to take advantage of the rainy season. The sandy soils
of Fort Ord do not retain moisture well, but the winter rains do
help the seeds get established. The Monterey Peninsula fog provides
additional moisture and protection for the emerging plants.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Melissa Boyd is one of the crew members. A senior from Chino,
Boyd was attracted to CSUMB by its location, but came with little
knowledge of the restoration work that was happening here.</p>
<p>She said she was in Professor Suzanne Worcester&#x2019;s biology class
during her sophomore year when she heard about a job with the
Return of the Natives program.</p>
<p>Through the program, elementary students come to Fort Ord to
experience plant growth and restoration first-hand. Then, they
return to see the changes that result.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is cool for them to be able to come back and see what they
have planted. I think that makes a real impression,&#x201D; Boyd said.</p>
<p>Her work with the Return of the Natives program brought Boyd to
the attention of Burleson and the organizers of the restoration
project. Her flexible hours there fit well around her class
work.<br>
Now, she is looking into a graduate program in Hawaii as a way to
continue her studies in environmental restoration.</p>
<p>Late this summer, Boyd was just beginning to work with a new
student employee working on the Fort Ord restoration project.</p>
<p class="pullquote">See a <a href="../../../../gallery/fort-ord-monument-restoration.html" rel="nofollow">photo gallery</a> illustrating the restoration
process.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s only been a week or so,&#x201D; Boyd said. &#x201C;She has a few things
to learn, but she&#x2019;s picking things up really quickly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And the cycle continues.&#xA0;</p>
