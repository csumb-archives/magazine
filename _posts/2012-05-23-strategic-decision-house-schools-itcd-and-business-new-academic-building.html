<p>Planning is under way for the next academic
building on the CSU Monterey&#xA0;Bay campus. Located on Divarty
Street near the Tanimura &amp; Antle&#xA0;library, the new building
will house the schools of Business and Information&#xA0;Technology
&amp; Communication Design (ITCD).</p>
<p>The building will enhance the learning of business and
technology by&#xA0;providing shared spaces for students and faculty
members to work on innovative&#xA0;projects.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Putting these two schools together was a strategic decision,&#x201D;
said Dr. Eric&#xA0;Tao, chair of ITCD. &#x201C;We are educating a new
generation of students who&#xA0;can integrate technology and
business practices.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Students working together will help to encourage the spirit of
innovation&#xA0;and entrepreneurship crucial for learning and for
the future of America&#x2019;s&#xA0;economy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Dr. Marylou Shockley, chair of the School of Business, echoed
that sentiment.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Collaboration will benefit both ITCD and business students
through&#xA0;projects that will promote community economic
development,&#x201D; Dr. Shockley&#xA0;said.</p>
<p>The technology-rich building will cover 58,000 square feet on
three levels&#xA0;tied together by an atrium and will incorporate a
variety of energy-saving&#xA0;features. Eight classrooms and 14
laboratories are planned, along with&#xA0;faculty and department
offices, conference rooms, student study areas and&#xA0;lounge, and
office space for the dean of the College of Professional
Studies.&#xA0;HMC Architects of San Jose is in charge of the
design.</p>
<p>Private support will permit a margin of excellence beyond what
state&#xA0;financing can provide, allowing the university to
innovate, integrate and&#xA0;inspire.</p>
<p>For information, contact Dr. Patti Hiramoto, vice president for
university&#xA0;advancement, at 831-582-3936.</p>
