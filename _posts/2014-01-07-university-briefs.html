<h4>Presidential investiture set for Nov. 15</h4>
<p>The investiture of Dr. Eduardo M. Ochoa as president of Cal
State Monterey Bay will be held at 2:30 p.m. Friday, Nov. 15, in
the World Theater on campus. The event will also be video-streamed
to other campus sites.</p>
<p>A reception will follow at the University Center.</p>
<p>CSU Chancellor Timothy White will attend the investiture, along
with members of the Cal State Board of Trustees and a number of Dr.
Ochoa&#x2019;s presidential colleagues from around the CSU. Former
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta will give a keynote address.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Nov. 16, the university will hold a community Day
of Service in conjunction with the investiture and in keeping with
the campus&#x2019;s emphasis on service learning and community
outreach.</p>
<p>Dr. Ochoa becomes the third permanent president in the
university&#x2019;s history, following Dr. Peter Smith (1995-2005) and Dr.
Dianne Harrison (2006-2012). Dr. Diane Cordero de Noriega served as
interim president between Smith and Harrison.</p>
<p>At its May 2013 meeting, the California State University Board
of Trustees appointed Dr. Ochoa as permanent president of Cal State
Monterey Bay. He had served in that position on an interim basis
since July 2012.</p>
<h4>Blanco named interim provost</h4>
<p>Dr. Julio Blanco, dean of the School of
Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering and professor of
physics at CSU Bakersfield, is now interim provost and vice
president for academic affairs at Cal State Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>At CSU Bakersfield, Dr. Blanco increased the number of students
in science, technology and math majors; lessened the gender gap in
those majors, and increased external support through grants and
contracts.</p>
<p>He moved to CSU Bakersfield from CSU Northridge, where he began
his academic career as a teaching assistant in 1974 and advanced
through the ranks to full professor in 1997. He served as
department chair from 2001 to 2006.</p>
<p>Dr. Blanco earned his doctorate in physics from Penn State
University and his master&#x2019;s and bachelor&#x2019;s degrees in physics from
CSU Northridge. He succeeds Dr. Kathryn Cruz-Uribe, who is now
chancellor of Indiana University East.</p>
