<p>Petra Mansfield commutes 75 miles, one way, to take classes
leading to&#xA0;her master&#x2019;s of social work degree at Cal State
Monterey Bay.&#xA0;</p>
<p>That may seem like a long trip&#x2026;until you consider the
obstacles&#xA0;Mansfield has already overcome in pursuit of her
education.</p>
<p>The mother of six grown children, Mansfield, 59, lives with her
husband in&#xA0;San Ardo, a small town in south Monterey County.
She works for the<a href="http://www.kinshipcenter.org" rel="nofollow">Kinship&#xA0;Center</a>, a non-profit adoption, foster
care and relative care agency.</p>
<p>Raised in a rural village in Mexico, Mansfield had little
exposure to formal&#xA0;education until after coming to the U.S. as
a teenager.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was fascinated by the English language and wanted to learn
it. Television&#xA0;was good for me. I used to watch the &#x2018;I Love
Lucy&#x2019; shows. I liked Lucy&#x2019;s enthusiasm&#xA0;and her comedy, and her
husband was Hispanic, and I could identify with
that,&#x201D;&#xA0;Mansfield said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Learning to speak the language wasn&#x2019;t enough. I wanted to learn
to&#xA0;read. But because I never went to school in Mexico, it was
challenging.&#xA0;The dictionary was my best friend. I would read a
definition<br>
of one word and in that definition, I found other words I
had&#xA0;to look up,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Eventually, she earned her GED, and began her pursuit&#xA0;of a
degree at Hartnell College. She acknowledges it&#xA0;was
intimidating at first, but she found plenty of helpful&#xA0;staff
and faculty, first at Hartnell and then at Cal&#xA0;State Monterey
Bay, to keep her going.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I believe this school really means what it says&#xA0;when it
comes to empowering students and the&#xA0;mission statement. I like
how they focus on diversity&#xA0;and ethics. We (the graduates)
really carry&#xA0;that with us,&#x201D; Mansfield said.</p>
<p>She is on track to receive her MSW in May&#xA0;and she plans to
continue to work on issues&#xA0;she sees in her community.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My goal is to be able to provide support&#xA0;to families in
South County. There are a lot of&#xA0;mental health issues, gang
issues,&#x201D; she said.&#xA0;&#x201C;You see people coming from Mexico&#xA0;in
search of a better life. Often the parents&#xA0;have to work 10-12
hours a day out in the&#xA0;fields, and who is babysitting the
children&#xA0;then? What kind of care are they getting?&#x201D;</p>
