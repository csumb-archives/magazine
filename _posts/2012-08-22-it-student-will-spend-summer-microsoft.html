<p>What was once a hobby is now a career focus for Ian Bowers, a
junior transfer student from Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>Bowers was drawn to CSU Monterey Bay to pursue a degree in
computer science and information technology because, he said, &#x201C;I
liked how the program is set up, and I liked the faculty. They&#x2019;re
all passionate about teaching and are really helpful.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Since his father worked in the field, he grew up around
computers. &#x201C;I thought of it as a hobby, but about three years ago I
started to put it together that this was what I could do for a
career,&#x201D; Bowers said.</p>
<p>He got a head start on that career when he landed a 12-week
summer internship with Microsoft, an opportunity he learned of
through the campus-based Monterey Bay Regional Academy of Computing
Education.</p>
<p>The very competitive process involved a trip to Microsoft&#x2019;s
headquarters in Seattle. He had six separate hour-long interviews
in a single day.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was intimidating because I was talking to students from
schools all over the country, many of them from big schools,&#x201D;
Bowers said. &#x201C;In my group of 12, two were from MIT.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Bowers landed one of the coveted interships.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be developing software, as well as creating tools that
other developers will use to test software,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s an
entry-level position, but it&#x2019;s a good way to learn to be an
engineer &#x2013; to break things.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
<em><strong>Editor&apos;s Note:</strong> At the conclusion of his
internship, Bowers got good news &#x2013; once he graduates next May,
he&apos;ll have a job waiting for him at Microsoft.</em></p>
