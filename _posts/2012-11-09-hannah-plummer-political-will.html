<p class="fineprint">Hannah Plummer with Congressman Kevin
McCarthy</p>
<p>Hannah Plummer, a senior business major, was selected for the
Congressional Internship Program sponsored by the Panetta Institute
for Public Policy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Members of Congress are up for re-election this year, and some
of the work that I do may help to change this nation&#x2019;s future in a
very small way,&#x201D; Plummer said. &#x201C;I couldn&#x2019;t pass up the opportunity
to spend three months in D.C. doing something that I&#x2019;m passionate
about.&#x201D;</p>
<p>After two weeks of orientation at the Panetta Institute, the
interns head to Washington, where they spend 11 weeks working in
the office of a member of Congress from California.</p>
<p>Plummer, 21, will earn a semester&#x2019;s worth of academic credits.
She will graduate in May.</p>
<p>The Murrieta resident has been politically active since coming
to CSUMB in 2008. She&#x2019;s been a volunteer in several local election
campaigns, and been a member and chair of the Otter College
Republicans.</p>
