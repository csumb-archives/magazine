<p>You never feel alone at CSUMB.</p>
<p>Robert Embree knows this first-hand. The Navy veteran and
re-entry student just completed the MBA program at CSUMB &#x2013; and is
already an avid supporter. His passion is to help secure resources
that directly assist students, such as tutors, math centers and
writing labs.</p>
<p>Embree, who operates a clinical diagnostic laboratory in
Southern California, sees the value of education first hand. The
process of acquiring the knowledge can be as valuable as the
knowledge itself, according to Embree.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I see a different level of professionalism with college
graduates &#x2013; you&#x2019;re exposed to different fields and learn from other
disciplines,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>However, many students drop out because they don&#x2019;t know how much
assistance is really out there. Embree wants to change that. In
addition to a monetary gift upon his graduation, he also donated
his cap and gown for a future graduate to use.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Everyone should have the opportunity to pursue their gifts,
learn from others and realize their dreams.&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;CSUMB gave
me that support. Now it&#x2019;s my turn.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p>
