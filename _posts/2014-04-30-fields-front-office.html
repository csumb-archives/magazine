<h5>Tanimura Family Foundation scholarship launches ex-Marine&#x2019;s
agribusiness career</h5>
<p>Gustavo Torres grew up surrounded by agriculture. His family
lived in Salinas; his parents worked in the fields, picking
strawberries.</p>
<p>The message he got from them was simple: Get an education.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My parents always told my brothers and me how hard it is to
work in the fields. They did not want us to end up doing that,&#x201D;
Torres said.</p>
<p>A summer job set him on his career path. After
a stint in the Marine Corps, he started as a general laborer at
Driscoll&#x2019;s, the Central Coast berry grower, while a student at
Hartnell College. His original plan was to parlay his love of math
into a career as a&#xA0;civil engineer.</p>
<p>Torres switched to agribusiness when, at the suggestion of a
co-worker, he took a class in the subject and realized he enjoyed
it. He earned an associate&#x2019;s degree and transferred to CSU Monterey
Bay in spring 2012.</p>
<p>He&apos;s graduating with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in business
administration and a concentration in agribusiness management.</p>
<p>His job responsibilities grew along with his academic success.
He&#x2019;s now logistics coordinator for Driscoll&#x2019;s Salinas distribution
center, where he oversees day-to-day operations. He plans to stay
there after graduation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Having my degree will definitely open doors to new
opportunities,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;My goal is to move into a management
position, gain as much experience as I can, and keep working my way
up.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Getting an agribusiness degree and giving back to the industry
that made it possible gives me a sense of accomplishment,&#x201D; he said.
Torres, 34, benefitted from the Tanimura Family Foundation&#x2019;s
scholarships for students studying agribusiness management. &#x201C;Their
generosity has allowed me to be one step closer to my goal,&#x201D; he
said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Earning my degree will also demonstrate to my parents that
their sacrifices will not have been in vain. They came to this
country in search of a better life for their family and themselves,
and they have also succeeded in what they set out &#xA0;to
do.&#x201D;<br>
