<h5>CSU faculty, students helping city of Monterey find answers to
beach erosion</h5>
<p>By Liz MacDonald</p>
<p>The beaches and coastlines of Monterey Bay
change every year as winter storms bring high surf that erodes the
land. This can mean trouble for coastal properties such as the Del
Monte Beach townhomes, perched just above the beach berm.</p>
<p>One way to manage erosion and protect property is called beach
nourishment. It involves depositing sand in front of the threatened
structures on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Faculty and students from CSUMB&#x2019;s Division of Science &amp;
Environmental Policy are using a specialized beach cart to measure
the effectiveness of this approach. The cart scans the beach with a
sophisticated laser array called LiDAR. Researchers use this data
set to create precise computer models of the beach and sea cliffs.
By taking repeated scans over a series of months, they&#x2019;ll be able
to determine how much erosion is occurring, and how well the beach
nourishment program is working.</p>
<p>Traditionally these types of surveys are conducted from either a
single location or by airplane.</p>

Chambers, CSU Fresno graduate student; Jeff Papendick, CSU Fresno
undergraduate researcher; Mathieu Richard, assistant professor,
Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, CSU Fresno; and
Rikk Kvitek, CSUMB professor of Science &amp; Environmental Policy
and director of the Seafloor Mapping Laboratory.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The beach cart is unique, and suited to the Del Monte Beach
project, because we are able to survey more area than would be
feasible from fixed locations while avoiding the cost and
preparation time involved in an aerial survey,&#x201D; said Alex Snyder, a
graduate student in the Applied Marine &amp; Watershed Science
program who is spearheading the effort.</p>
