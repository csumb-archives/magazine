<p>Bruce Woolpert lived by the principles of
hard work and changing lives. He was a respected community member
and a beloved father and husband. As the former CEO of Graniterock,
he was a mentor and friend to many.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Bruce passed away this year in a tragic boating accident. To
honor his legacy, the Woolpert Foundation is supporting the Algebra
Academy, an innovative program developed by CSUMB and Graniterock
which provides intensive mentoring in algebra during a one-week
period for Rolling Hills Middle School students.</p>
<p>Bruce championed the development of the Algebra Academy. As a
UCLA math major, he thought math was a key to learning. He tutored
his own children. Later, Bruce took his love for the subject to the
local community.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He would come home from the Algebra Academy and he was so
excited&#x2026;Bruce was thrilled these kids were getting the experience
and their parents were involved,&#x201D; said Rose Ann Woolpert, his
wife.</p>
<p>Bruce worked closely with CSUMB math professor Hongde Hu. As
part of the academy, middle school students, many of whom would be
first-generation college students, come to CSUMB and study algebra
on campus for a day. It allows students to visualize a university
setting, meet people like Professor Hu and realize that college is
for them.</p>
<p>In addition to the Algebra Academy, Bruce was passionate about
giving his employees at Graniterock the tools to better themselves.
He supported programs at work to improve reading and math
skills.<br>
Math doesn&#x2019;t come easily for everyone. However, working on math
skills in middle school can greatly improve performance in high
school and college. &#x201C;When you work for something, you value it more
&#x2013; and importantly, it gives you confidence,&#x201D; said Rose Ann. &#x201C;Bruce
knew that. Math was his great joy.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p>
