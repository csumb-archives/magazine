<p><strong>Explain what your business
is/does?</strong></p>
<p>Yo! Yo! SEO is an SEO consulting agency that helps businesses
optimize their online marketing strategies with a focus on search
engine optimization (SEO) and audience engagement. To break that
down in simpler terms, we help businesses be found in Google and
social media.<br>
<br>
<strong>When did you start it?</strong></p>
<p>The company launched mid-2009 as a rebranding of a previous
company, Pixel Position.<br>
<br>
<strong>Why did you start it?</strong></p>
<p>I was previously focused more on pure SEO; however, the online
marketing landscape was quickly changing to include more emphasis
on quality content, engagement with audiences on Twitter, Facebook,
and other social networks. Yo! Yo! SEO was birthed to do just that,
shout out a Yo! Let me break it down for you:<br>
<br>
Yo! &#x2014; Listen<br>
Listen to what people are saying, the questions they ask, and how
your competition is engaging.<br>
<br>
Yo! &#x2014; Engage<br>
Engage your audience on and off your site. Join
conversations.<br>
<br>
SEO &#x2014; Optimize<br>
Optimize and organize your website to meet your audience&#x2019;s needs,
creating content people want to share, talk about, and link
to.<br>
<br>
<strong>How did the recession affect you and your
business?</strong></p>
<p>It has resulted in more work than expected. Companies have had
to cut budgets, and often their print advertising goes first.
However, they have realized their need to be visible online. The
result has been that we have had a consistent stream of clients and
needs. Much of our work involves SEO audits to provide companies
with insight into how they can optimize their websites. This saves
them money in the long run and can help them get more leads and
sales.<br>
<br>
<strong>What do you like about your work?</strong></p>
<p>The people. I get to work with a wide range of people and learn
a lot about diverse industries. I get a chance to work my strengths
and outsource my weaknesses. I&#x2019;m able to work from home and
collaborate with those who work with me remotely. I travel to meet
with clients and to attend and speak at industry conferences. I&#x2019;m
networked with a number of incredibly smart people who challenge me
regularly, and I&#x2019;m constantly learning. I&#x2019;m literally living my
dream!<br>
<br>
<strong>What are the challenges?</strong></p>
<p>That constant learning part. Given that Google changes its
algorithms &gt;500 times a year on average, it&#x2019;s tough to keep up
with it all. In addition, search engines are not the only players.
Keeping up with changes with Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc. is a
challenge. How do I overcome that? I read a lot and stay connected
and networked.<br>
<br>
The challenges of running a business is the other aspect. Many days
are long (very long), but it&#x2019;s worth it.</p>
<p><strong>How did your CSUMB education prepare you?</strong></p>
<p>When I went back to school and entered the Information
Technology &amp; Communication Design program at CSUMB, my goal was
to acquire skills that built upon my strengths &#x2013; people, writing,
and technology. I&#x2019;m now working in Internet marketing that requires
content writing with a focus on people and a need for backend
technology and code. I also do a lot of training in my work. Having
the opportunity to teach Web Design after I graduated and many of
the skills learned studying Instructional Technology were
invaluable.<br>
<br>
I literally would not be able to do what I am doing today without
the education and experience at CSUMB. I owe that to a number of
people at CSUMB, such as Greg Pool, John Ittelson, Marsha Moroh,
and many more!<br>
<br>
<strong>Do you have any advice for others who may be considering
starting a business?</strong></p>
<p>This is my 4th company I&#x2019;ve operated, and I&#x2019;ve experienced some
bumps and bruises along the way. There&#x2019;s a lot that one needs to
know and understand. My degree in Business Administration helped
tremendously, because you need to understand a lot about contracts
and law. Understanding the legalities is one good place to start.
Overall, however, the following would be my top 5
recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on something about which you are passionate. It needs to
be something that you would do late at night when no one is
watching or prompting you to do. You must love it!</li>
<li>Make sure there is a market for your service or product.
Research your audience and the competition.</li>
<li>If you do not already have good writing skills, get them! You&#x2019;d
be surprised at how many business people lose credibility due to
poor grammar, punctuation, and spelling. How you present yourself
in emails, proposals, and other written communications makes a huge
difference.</li>
<li>Due your due diligence before partnering with anyone, and pay
all your taxes.</li>
<li>Secure your company&#x2019;s identity online. Before you even
establish your business name, make sure you can get your domain
name and social profiles.</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
<strong>Anything else you&apos;d like to add?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for asking, because I think there are two additional key
ingredients to success that applies to all majors and fields.</p>
<p>Give more than you expect to receive.</p>
<p>Listen twice as much as you speak. We have two ears and one
mouth. Use them in that proportion!&#xA0;</p>
