<p>Dear friends of CSU Monterey Bay,</p>
<p>I have seldom been more proud than I was in January when I
represented our university in Washington, D.C., at a program called
the White House Convening on Civic Learning. CSU Monterey Bay was
showcased as a role model for how we engage our students in the
world around them and prepare them to be active, involved
citizens.</p>
<p>That success, and its many outcomes, are the subject of the
cover story in this edition of the CSUMB magazine. As always, the
magazine includes stories of our university that are sources of
pride for all of us &#x2013; the talents and accomplishments of our
students, the anticipation surrounding our new Bachelor of Nursing
Program, the impressive performance of our women&#x2019;s basketball team,
and the generosity of our donors.</p>
<p>Pride is just one of the emotions I feel as I prepare to
conclude my tenure as president of CSU Monterey Bay and prepare to
serve as president of CSU Northridge. For six years, I have joined
with you &#x2013; our alumni and friends &#x2013; and with our wonderful
students, faculty and staff &#x2013; to continue the historic development
of this great university.</p>
<p>Together, we have collectively expanded our academic programs,
both graduate and undergraduate; we have greatly improved the
experience of our students, both in and out of the classroom; and
we have watched our enrollment grow as constant improvement has
made CSUMB a destination campus. All of this has been accomplished
in spite of repeated cuts in state funding for higher
education.</p>
<p>We have remained focused on our foremost objective: the success
of our students. I am confident that with your help, CSU Monterey
Bay will maintain that priority as it continues to evolve and
flourish.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Dianne F. Harrison, Ph.D.<br>
