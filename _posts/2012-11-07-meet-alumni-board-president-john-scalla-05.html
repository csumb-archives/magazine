<p></p>
<p><strong>Term:</strong>&#xA0;July 2012-June 2013</p>
<p><strong>Degree: &#xA0;</strong>Telecommunications, Multimedia,
and Applied Computing B.S.</p>
<p><strong>Hometowns:</strong> San Jose and Hollister, now lives in
Marina</p>
<p><strong>Job:</strong> Technical Sales Director for Evolution
Circuits</p>
<p><strong>Motto:</strong> &#x201C;Get ugly early,&#x201D; meaning don&#x2019;t
procrastinate. When you do what you need to early, all that&#x2019;s left
is the stuff you enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Little known fact:</strong> Started out as a Liberal
Studies major</p>
<p><strong>Faculty mentor:</strong> Dr. Eric Tao. As a student I
always went to him for advice and help. I would not have taken some
of the courses I did without his guidance or wish to give back to
CSUMB as much as I am now without his motivation to do the
same.</p>
<p><strong>Mission as board president:</strong> Keeping the school
spirit alive in fellow alumni through events such as reunion
weekend and sharing the story of CSUMB graduates doing absolutely
amazing things in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Memorable CSUMB moments:</strong> Working as an RA and
doing the &#x201C;Sex Talk&#x201D; program in which students ask about being
safe, general dating questions, advice, etc. It was completely
anonymous. Some of the questions were hilarious, some serious. But
every discussion was awesome. Sometimes people laughed so hard they
cried. It was a very good program and people still talk about what
they remember from it. It is exciting to know we did something
people still talk about.</p>
<p>Also, the moment of silence between just ending my capstone
presentation and the applause after. It was this very moment that I
knew things would never be the same, but they will be better. It
was a rush of emotion and a feeling of deep accomplishment. I loved
that moment!</p>
<p><strong>Advice for current students:</strong> Never fall behind.
Stay ahead of what you need to do or accomplish. &#xA0;</p>
