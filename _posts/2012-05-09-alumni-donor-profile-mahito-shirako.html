<p>The beloved spirit of CSUMB employee and
former student Mahito Shirako lives on in a Memorial Scholarship
account that has grown to over $20,000 since his passing in
November 2010. That will allow a scholarship in his name to be
awarded to a deserving CSUMB student every year, in perpetuity.</p>
<p>Shirako, who died in a motorcycle accident, was known for his
full embrace of life &#x2013; enthusiasm for his hobbies, a passion for
music, skilled work as an audio-visual specialist, and deep bonds
of friendship.</p>
<p>In addition to individual contributions from friends, family,
coworkers and alumni, the Mahito Shirako Foundation raised
significant funds through several special events that reflected
Shirako&#x2019;s zest for life. Among them were a memorial motorcycle ride
and barbecue, a &#x201C;Mahitopoalooza&#x201D; music and comedy festival, and the
Warrior Dash, a 3-kilometer run and obstacle course. Future events
are planned.</p>
