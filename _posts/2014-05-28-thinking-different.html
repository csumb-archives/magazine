<h3>Johanna Poethig keeps the vision of VPA alive</h3>
<p class="small">By PATIA STEPHENS</p>
<p class="intro">As one of CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s founding faculty
members, Professor Johanna Poethig has been with the Visual &amp;
Public Art Department since its inception in 1995.</p>
<p>The VPA program was one of the first in the
country that emphasized not just the visual, but also the social
aspects of art education.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The beauty of this program is that we do both,&#x201D; Poethig said.
&#x201C;Students come here, they gotta learn skills. They have to learn
how to be studio artists, and think about their personal creativity
and creative growth. But they do that within a curriculum of
thinking about how art takes place in a social context.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Born in New Jersey and raised in Manila, Philippines, Poethig
earned degrees from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and
Mills College. She&#x2019;s been in California since 1976, forging an
eclectic career out of a variety of interests and mediums, from
painting and sculpture to performance art and video.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a lot of different things,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s just who I
am. ... Rather than choose, I do it all.&#x201D;<br>
Her installations include dozens of large-scale murals, many of
which transform urban blight into pockets of color and meaning. In
her Painting and Mural class, students are working on a vivid,
300-foot-long mural in the rural farmworker community of
Pajaro.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This community has had nothing &#x2013; no place for the kids to play,
no place for the community to get together,&#x201D; Poethig said. The new
park is &#x201C;really kind of amazing &#x2013; it&#x2019;s like an oasis.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Public art education develops skills useful in any career, like
creativity and teamwork, Poethig said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The main thing about artists is that we&#x2019;re not literal all the
time,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re creative, so we&#x2019;re divergent thinkers.
That&#x2019;s a very important part of learning. If you just train
[students] in a linear fashion, they&#x2019;ll never become as creative as
when you help them make connections that are surprising. It&#x2019;s only
by making those unlikely connections that you get innovative
ideas.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Another project is renewal of the campus &#x201C;Signs and Symbols&#x201D;
mural, which was removed for lead abatement. Poethig is leading the
effort, which will involve faculty members, students and alumni in
planning and painting a new version of the beloved mural.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It will reflect on the vision of the university and draw upon
the old design,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t want to forget your history,
but you also want to look toward the future.&#x201D;
