<p>For Emma Ramirez, being a foster child didn&#x2019;t
define who she is or where she is going.</p>
<p>At CSU Monterey Bay, she&#x2019;s working to make sure other former
foster youth can say the same thing.<br>
&#x201C;My goal growing up was to graduate from high school,&#x201D; Ramirez
said. &#x201C;Now, I&#x2019;d like to earn a master&#x2019;s degree in higher education
administration. I&#x2019;d like to create an Upward Bound-type program for
foster students.&#x201D;</p>
<p>CSUMB is among an increasing number of colleges and universities
that offer more services to students who grew up in foster care,
including a support group that meets regularly at the Personal
Growth and Counseling Center. Several years ago, the university
established a Former Foster Youth President&#x2019;s Advisory Council to
identify needs and establish programs to meet them. The university
and the Monterey County Department of Social and Employment
Services recently signed an agreement to identify foster youth
while they&#x2019;re still in high school and help them transition to the
university. Ramirez, a junior Liberal Studies major, has met with
campus administratorsto talk about the needs of former foster
youth. She and other students from similar backgrounds identified
year-round housing as a roadblock to college. That&#x2019;s now available
to them at CSUMB. Also, a retention adviser in the Educational
Opportunity Program has been assigned to work with them.</p>
<p>Ramirez has taken her advocacy work on behalf of foster youth
beyond campus. She is vice president of Monterey&#x2019;s chapter of
California Youth Connection, an organization of current and former
foster youth who advocate in Sacramento. The group had a role in
last year&#x2019;s passage of Assembly Bill 12, which extends the age at
which students age out of care from 18 to 20.<br>
She also serves as Monterey County&#x2019;s representative to the
statewide Youth Council, which works with several state agencies on
implementing Assembly Bill 12. She travels to Sacramento every six
weeks to attend meetings.</p>
<p>Ramirez entered care at age 4 when her mother was deported. She
lived in nine homes. Her last placement came at age 11 in San
Diego, and she still considers that her home. After graduating from
high school and aging out of care at 18, she connected with CSUMB&#x2019;s
outreach programs to ease her transition to university life.</p>
<p>She&#x2019;s beating the odds. Only half of foster children graduate
from high school, and only 20 percent of those enroll in college,
according to the Institute for Higher Education Policy. Fewer than
5 percent earn degrees.</p>
<p>While support programs can help ease the way, &#x201C;It comes down to
a personal decision,&#x201D; Ramirez said. &#x201C;You have to decide that you
want something better for yourself.&#x201D;</p>
