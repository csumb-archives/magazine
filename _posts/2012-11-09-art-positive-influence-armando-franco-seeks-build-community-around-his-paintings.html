<p>Armando Franco (&#x2019;11 VPA) stands behind the deejay booth at Blue
Fin Billiards on Cannery Row, the headphone wires dangling from his
ears. But instead of club gear, he wears paint-spattered jeans and
instead of spinning tunes, he&#x2019;s chalking up the outline of the
Statue of Liberty on the wall, one of the elements that will appear
in his next mural.</p>
<p>A nightclub may not be the first place one expects to see art,
but this is the second mural Franco has been commissioned to do at
Blue Fin. He aims to add color and energy to the dance area, and
incorporates materials such as glow-in-the-dark stars to complement
the black light and flickering lasers that usually illuminate the
room. Perhaps it isn&#x2019;t such a surprising venue for an artist who
cites hip hop, graffiti and Jean-Michel Basquiat as
inspirations.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want my art to help bring people out where they can make
connections,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I want it to create a positive influence on
my community, my peers and my family.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This desire also led him to create a series of landscapes and
architectural paintings for the Monterey County Rape Crisis
Center&#x2019;s Denim campaign. He became involved with MCRCC through his
sister, Rosio Franco, who worked there as a CSUMB service
learner.</p>
<p>Franco is also an active volunteer at Dorothy&#x2019;s Kitchen. He
started going to Dorothy&#x2019;s to work on his Capstone project, a mural
done with fellow student David Castillo &#x2019;11, but he has kept it up
because, he says, &#x201C;working there, you form relationships with the
people. You don&#x2019;t just stop going.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Franco, who grew up in Gilroy, explored a number of majors,
including business, psychology and music, before honing in on his
passion for art. At one point, unable to settle on a major, the
first-generation college student felt lost and almost dropped out.
&#x201C;I will love that university forever, because they gave me a second
chance,&#x201D; he says.</p>
<p>He credits the support he received through the CAMP and EOP
programs for keeping him in school. &#x201C;They helped me put my head in
the right place, helped me believe in myself,&#x201D; he says. The
one-on-one attention he received from the Visual and Public Art
faculty further cemented his commitment to graduating, and his
fraternity brothers in Omega Delta Phi helped him keep his
academics in line.</p>
<p>On campus, Franco became known for his works
in blue masking tape. One of his first projects, done through the
student club Working Hard as Artists Together, is still on display
in the Student Center. He followed that up with tributes to Frida
Kahlo and Vincent Van Gogh in East Campus residences. &#x201C;I like blue
tape because it doesn&#x2019;t damage the wall,&#x201D; he says. He&#x2019;s also
learned to push the limits of the tape, crumpling it to create
texture and more sophisticated designs.</p>
<p>These days, in addition to the murals at Blue Fin and a job
doing custom art framing at Michael&#x2019;s, Franco is working on a
series of smaller scale paintings on Dia de los Muertos themes.
These pieces are psychedelic and colorful &#x2013; Franco says developing
a sense of color is an important part of his process now. He hopes
to sell these works on his website, EternalCognition.Tumblr.com,
and donate the proceeds to an area nonprofit.<br>
