<h3>A Q&amp;A with Dr. Suzanne
Worcester&#xA0;</h3>
<p class="fineprint">Interview by George Machun</p>
<p>Native plants are becoming more popular across the country as
gardeners look for reduced maintenance and low water options for
their landscapes. We asked CSUMB Professor of Science and
Environmental Policy Suzanne Worcester about the benefits of
gardening with native plants.</p>
<h6>How and when did you first get involved in growing native
plants?</h6>
<p>We have been landscaping our house with natives for more than 15
years. I have known about the benefits of native plants since my
graduate work in the early 1990s when I learned that the classic
&#x201C;golden hills of California&#x201D; are only golden in early summer
because of exotic grasses brought here. That revelation opened my
eyes to start seeing California in a whole new light.</p>
<p>Exotic species are those that have been brought to an area by
people (either intentionally or unintentionally) but did not grow
naturally like native species. Invasive species are exotic species
which spread rapidly and outcompete native species. This can occur
for different reasons -- perhaps they aren&#x2019;t eaten by local
animals, or they make the soil around them toxic to other plants
(i.e., eucalyptus trees), or they have no natural pathogens.</p>
<p>Ice plant and french broom are good examples of invasive species
on the Monterey Peninsula. Ice plant is the one that carpets the
dunes in a monoculture while French broom is the beautiful
yellow-flowered shrub that completely covers hillsides and is
extremely difficult to remove (or contain it where you want it in
your yard).</p>
<h6>How popular are native plants today vs. 10
years ago?</h6>
<p>Native plants have become more and more popular. I see
increasing numbers of houses landscaped with natives as well as new
businesses. For instance, many of the plants around the new CHOMP
Health and Wellness Center just north of campus are native.
CalTrans has been taking out invasive species along our highways
and replacing them with natives such as <a href="http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-calrecnum=3618" rel="nofollow">fremontodendron</a> (also called flannel bush or
California glory), California lilacs and oaks.</p>
<h6><strong>Are consumers seeing the benefits to going native or
are there misconceptions out there?</strong></h6>
<p>Many people see the benefits of natives. They take much less
water than lawns and other traditional landscaping. The lower costs
in terms of effort, water and fertilizer really add up for people
keen to save both money and time.</p>
<p>I think knowledge of California&#x2019;s unique ecology is becoming
more widespread as well. When people learn that the invasive plants
in their yard are responsible for the decline of our native flora
and fauna in the region, they realize they have a part in keeping
the greater Monterey area beautiful and vibrant. Many want to do
their part by taking out invasive species and planting natives once
they have that knowledge.</p>
<p>Butterflies, birds, bunnies and even lizards all enjoy native
plants. At our house we really like watching the baby bunnies
nibbling on the grasses in our yard (and weeding the yard for us!).
We also have a wide variety of birds. For instance, we have a covey
of quail in the yard that has become the focus of a local
sharp-shinned hawk. The hawk and quail have these amazing
high-speed, mid-air chases through the yard as one tries to
outmaneuver the other. It can be quite exciting!</p>
<p>Another advantage is that natives reseed themselves and are
self-sustaining. It takes a lot of work to replant marigolds every
spring, but native beach evening primroses and beach strawberries
just spring up and bloom each year.</p>
<p>One of the challenges in growing natives is that some people
feel that the drier, native California look is not as attractive.
However I think that Sunset magazine and local garden tours have
illustrated how some of the most attractive and prize-winning
gardens in our region are those that grow drought-tolerant plants
dominated by natives.&#xA0;</p>
<h6><strong>How is growing native plants
different from traditional gardening?</strong></h6>
<p>Native plants follow the natural seasons in California. This
means that they often lose their leaves during the late summer dry
season and look their best in the winter, spring and early summer.
Gardeners can get around these trends by planting species that
bloom at different time periods to add color to their yards. For
instance, <a href="http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-calrecnum=2984" rel="nofollow">California fuchsia</a> is a beautiful red
hummingbird-pollinated plant that blooms late into the summer. Also
many native species in the sunflower family bloom in September and
October. Careful planning can allow a gardener to have beautiful
blooms in late summer and fall, and also allow some plants in the
garden to go dormant (following the natural climate in central and
southern California). If we think like the seasons then it is much
easier to &#x201C;go with the flow&#x201D; with our landscaping.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Some natives are more finicky than typical garden store
plants--for instance, once they are established some will die if
you give them water in the summer. The advantage, of course, is you
can ignore them completely when you are on vacation. This is true
for one of my favorites, the fremontodendron or flannel bush. It
requires water during its first, and possible second, summers to
get established. After that time it grows best with no
irrigation--ever!</p>
<p>One of the wonders of ice plant is that you don&#x2019;t have to do
anything to get it to grow (the reason some people choose this
plant). Of course, on the flipside it is very difficult to contain
and requires continual work to trim back and remove young sprouts
that come up in other places in your yard. Most natives aren&#x2019;t
quite so tenacious and difficult to keep in the places you want
them to grow. Thus natives have many of the advantages of exotic
invasives (many are easy to grow), but not the negatives (they can
be contained in certain areas in your yard).</p>
<h6><strong>What other guidance can you give to people considering
native plants?</strong></h6>
<p>There are lots of places to get advice. The <a href="http://watershed.csumb.edu/wi/" rel="nofollow">Watershed
Institute</a> on campus grows many local native plants and have
years of wisdom in how to grow them. The California Native Plant
Society (CNPS) has <a href="http://www.cnps.org/store.php" rel="nofollow">published many books</a> on growing natives as well. You
can browse the books in person and meet other native plant
enthusiasts at the monthly meeting of the local CNPS chapter. They
meet at the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History on the 2nd
Thursday of each month at 7 p.m.&#xA0;</p>
<h6>Are commercial retailers seeing the benefits of offering
natives?</h6>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;ve never shopped for plants at local retailers
like Target or OSH. I buy my native plants from the Elkhorn Native
Plant Nursery in Moss Landing or the native plant sales at <a href="http://www.ecoliteracy.org/schools/stories/mearth-hilton-bialek-habitat" rel="nofollow">MEarth</a> (the Hilton Bialeck Habitat at Carmel
Middle School). Also, the Watershed Institute on campus sometimes
has extra plants available.</p>
<h6>Finally, what are some of your favorite natives that can be
seen on campus?</h6>
<p>I&#x2019;ve already mentioned fremontodendron. It is a large shrub that
is covered in large yellow flowers--it is very showy. It stays at
least in bloom for months. It is easy to grow and grows quickly to
almost tree size. Our native brush rabbits (the cute little bunnies
that you see scurrying to hide under bushes) love to live under
fremontodendron and they eat the dying flowers after they&#x2019;ve
fallen. You can see it for yourself at several places on campus
including across from the library on the corner between the dorms
and the traffic circle. I also like California fuschia because it
is pretty and attracts hummingbirds.</p>
