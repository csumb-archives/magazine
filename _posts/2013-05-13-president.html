<p>Dear friends of Cal State Monterey Bay,</p>
<p>The first months of 2013 featured two impressive campus events
that told&#xA0;much about our achievements and aspirations as a
university.</p>
<p>February&#x2019;s Have a Heart for Students Fundraiser was particularly
memorable,&#xA0;not just for the more than $145,000 we raised, but
for the stories we heard from&#xA0;several students who receive
scholarships.&#xA0;Our outstanding speakers &#x2013; Julia Ashen, Julio
Castro and Emma Ramirez<br>
&#x2013; personified the range of students who benefit from Cal State
Monterey Bay&#x2019;s&#xA0;programs.</p>
<p>Julia was valedictorian at North Salinas High School before
coming to&#xA0;CSUMB, where she has starred both as a scholar and
as an all-conference&#xA0;member of our volleyball team. Julio, the
son of Mexican immigrants who&#xA0;strongly believe in the
importance of education, will graduate from our
university&#xA0;this spring. Emma is also on track to graduate, an
impressive accomplishment&#xA0;for a young woman who lived in 10
different foster homes before becoming a&#xA0;teenager.</p>
<p>Listen to these students, and you understand that Cal State
Monterey Bay is&#xA0;indeed a place of extraordinary
opportunity.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Then, in March, we hosted the Welcome Home
celebration for Leon Panetta,&#xA0;who represented the Central
Coast in Congress and rose to the highest ranks of&#xA0;the federal
government.&#xA0;As a congressman, Leon was in instrumental in
building political consensus&#xA0;around the establishment of our
university after the closure of Fort Ord.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The event was, by all accounts, a tremendous success. Well over
500 people&#xA0;attended the event. Many visited our campus for the
first time and came away&#xA0;impressed.</p>
<p>The Panetta Institute for Public Policy, located at CSUMB,
focuses on the&#xA0;importance of public service and civic
involvement. As such, its mission is&#xA0;perfectly aligned with
the goals of our university. We know that when we
work&#xA0;together, great things can re</p></div></div></div>n we
work&#xA0;together, great things can result &#x2013; such as Cal State
Monterey Bay.&#xA0;In partnership with the institute, our
university could seek no higher&#xA0;accomplishment than helping
develop the next generation of leaders who will&#xA0;follow in the
distinguished tradition of Monterey&#x2019;s favorite son &#x2013; Leon
Panetta.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Eduardo M. Ochoa</p>
