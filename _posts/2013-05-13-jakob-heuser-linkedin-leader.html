<p>If you&#x2019;re looking at LinkedIn.com or its
mobile site, chances are you&#x2019;re seeing Jakob Heuser&#x2019;s work. He is
the site&#x2019;s principal web and user interface developer &#x2013; a job he
describes&#xA0;as banging on the keyboard and making things
shiny.</p>
<p>He recently contributed his coding skills&#xA0;as part of the
team of designers and developers that came up with the new LinkedIn
profile interface. &#x201C;Our goal is for the profile to be the best
representation of the individual &#x2013; who they are, what they&#x2019;ve
accomplished,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>He joined the company back in 2008, one of just 10 people on the
web development team. In the years since, he&#x2019;s witnessed tremendous
growth at the company. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re up to 83 web developers, last time I
checked,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>The rapid growth and constantly changing landscape of the
web&#xA0;are two things Jakob finds most rewarding about his work.
The part he finds most challenging: making his sites work no matter
which browser a user comes to the site with &#x2013; even the old, clunky
ones.</p>
<p>Before LinkedIn, Jakob worked for another Silicon Valley
start-up called Gaia Online, which provided a virtual hangout for
teens in the era before Facebook. The 2004 Telecommunications,
Multimedia&#xA0;&amp; Applied Computing graduate credits his
capstone project for launching his career. &#x201C;Being able to show them
code I had actually written was instrumental to landing that first
job in the valley,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>The Sacramento-area-native found that CSUMB was a good incubator
for a self-motivated student. &#x201C;At CSUMB, you can make your own
opportunity and that mentality really does propel you,&#x201D; he
said.</p>
<p>This attitude was tested in Jakob&#x2019;s freshman year Tech Tools
class. Already&#xA0;very familiar with the basic computing skills
the class covered, he claimed to be bored. &#x201C;(Professor Rosalie
Strong) told me, don&#x2019;t just do the work &#x2013; help your classmates who
are struggling,&#x201D; he said. After that, Jakob spent the next three
years working on campus as a technology tutor.</p>
<p>After working in Silicon Valley for two years, Jakob enrolled in
CSUMB&#x2019;s online Master of Instructional Science &amp; Technology
program. He says he didn&#x2019;t get much sleep while working fulltime
and doing his master&#x2019;s remotely, but the instructors&#xA0;he&#x2019;d
worked with as an undergrad continued to be influential figures. He
completed his master&#x2019;s in 2008.</p>
<p>Jakob said the wide range of skills he gained at CSUMB have been
instrumental to his success. &#x201C;I had experience with instructional
design, Photoshop, Flash, how to make presentations, and
fundamental research skills,&#x201D; Jakob said. &#x201C;CSUMB gave me aspects of
the education you might get from a business school or art academy,
all rolled into one, and that has really helped me here.&#x201D;</p>
