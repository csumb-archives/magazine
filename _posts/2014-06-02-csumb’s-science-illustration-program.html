<h3>CSUMB&apos;s Science Illustration Program</h3>
<p class="small">By JOAN WEINER</p>
<p class="intro">A four-month residency at the San Francisco dump
changed the direction of Jane Kim&#x2019;s work.</p>
<p>There, the graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design used
construction scrap to investigate how walls &#x2013; and the way we
decorate them &#x2013; can have damaging environmental impacts.</p>
<p>That gave her a purpose, she said, &#x201C;beyond art for art&#x2019;s sake.&#x201D;
Inspired by science and the natural world, Kim decided to pursue a
certificate from CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s graduate-level science
illustration program.</p>
<p>Today, Kim is working on a series called
&#x201C;Migrating Mural,&#x201D; a collection of images painted along migration
corridors of endangered species. Through the murals, she said, the
transient life of these animals can easily be seen, and more
importantly, appreciated.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Jane has found ways to take what she loves and do some
magnificent work,&#x201D; said Ann Caudle, director of the science
illustration program. &#x201C;She has found her own niche.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So have many of the program&#x2019;s graduates, who work for
publications such as Scientific American and National Geographic;
museums, such as the Smithsonian and the American Museum of Natural
History; and at zoos, botanical gardens and aquariums.</p>
<p>Science illustration has been around a very long time. Roman
coins &#x2013; with their representations of plants that still exist &#x2013; are
early examples. Leonardo&#x2019;s human anatomy studies and Galileo&#x2019;s
drawings of the moon&#x2019;s cratered surface are other examples.
Illustrators accompanied Captain Cook and Charles Darwin on their
expeditions.</p>
<p>Even the binomial classification system created by Linnaeus &#x2013;
and still in use &#x2013; was introduced to the world through the work of
a science illustrator.</p>
<p>Ask Caudle why the discipline is still relevant &#x2013; given that
everyone has a camera-equipped cell phone &#x2013; and the answer comes
quickly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Illustrations can show us the inside of a
tornado,&#x201D; she said by way of example. &#x201C;And photos won&#x2019;t allow us to
go back in time to see species that existed in the past.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jenny Keller, an instructor in the program, added that
illustrations and animations explain new technologies and
advancements in science to the scientific community, as well as to
the curious public.</p>
<p>The work is all around us, if we just look &#x2013; in books and field
guides; adorning the walls of natural history museums; gracing
exhibit labels to help aquarium visitors tell the difference
between a sea lion and an otter; on interpretive signs in parks and
nature preserves.</p>
<p>The program started at UC Santa Cruz in the 1980s and moved to
CSUMB in 2009. It accepts 15 students a year among the 50 or so who
apply; they complete an academic year of classes and a 10-week
internship. They learn to sketch in the field and to design
information graphics and interactive displays.</p>
<p>Complementing the skills-based courses are instruction in
copyright, contract law and other real-world topics. Students
produce business cards and build portfolios while learning how to
pitch clients and publishers &#x2013; since many of them will work as
freelancers.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Because of the broad range of skills and their versatility and
flexibility, our graduates have quite an edge out there,&#x201D; Caudle
said.</p>
<p>Applicants include art students and people with a background in
science. That&#x2019;s not an odd combination. Both art and science are
about close observation, Caudle said, and the mix is beneficial for
both groups.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Artists look at things in a different way than scientists,&#x201D;
Caudle said. &#x201C;They look at color composition. That&#x2019;s fabulous for
the science students.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The learning, the training, a lot of it is the rich mix of
people in the program.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Corlis Schneider, who earned a certificate
from the program in 2011, combined interests in both science and
art.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When you&#x2019;re younger, you don&#x2019;t think there is a way to
reconcile a love for art and science,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;So you grow up focusing on science, like I did, or art.&#x201D;</p>
<p>While earning a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in marine biology from UC
Santa Cruz, she realized that her favorite classes were the labs
where students had to illustrate their specimens.</p>
<p>That led her to CSUMB&#x2019;s program. &#x201C;It was clearly the right
decision for me,&#x201D; she said. She&#x2019;s now a Los Angeles-based freelance
illustrator.</p>
<p>Julie Naylor Selan, a 2011 graduate of the program, is another
L.A-based freelancer. She specializes in wildlife and
paleontological illustration in traditional and digital media.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Growing up, my weekends were spent in aquariums, museums, at
the zoo or out on hikes,&#x201D; she said. At 15, she was certified as a
scuba diver and &#x201C;that opened up a whole new world.&#x201D; She, too, found
her way to the science illustration program. &#x201C;It was life-changing
for me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Kim shares the view. &quot;The science illustration program was one
of the most important decisions of my life,&quot; Kim said. &quot;Through the
program, I was able to define what sort of purpose art had for
me.</p>
<p>&quot;I learned new techniques, refined old ones and left the program
feeling very prepared,&quot; she said. MB</p>
