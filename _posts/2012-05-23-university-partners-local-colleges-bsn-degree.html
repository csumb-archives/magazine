Peninsula College.</p>
<h3>Yes to nursing</h3>
<p><strong>By Joan Weiner</strong></p>
<p>To help meet a growing demand for bachelor&#x2019;s-prepared nurses,
CSU<br>
Monterey Bay has added a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree
program, and the first class of students will start this
summer.</p>
<p>The program is launching at a critical time, when the pace of
change in nursing has rapidly accelerated.</p>
<p class="pullquote">To get involved:<br>
Fundraising is under way to meet the need for scholarships. If you
would like to help, contact Director of University De-<br>
velopment Barbara Zappas at 831-582-<br>

<p>The health care industry is coping with the &#x201C;silver tsunami&#x201D; of
aging babyboomers combined with the impact of health carereform,
and nurses will play a big role in meeting both challenges.</p>
<p>In a 2010 report, &#x201C;Th e Future of Nursing: Leading Change,
Advancing Health,&#x201D; the Institute of Medicine and the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation examined future demands. The report recommended
improving nursing education and suggested the proportion of nurses
with bachelor&#x2019;s degrees increase to 80 percent by 2020. Today, only
30 percent of California nurses have bachelor&#x2019;s degrees.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There is strong community support, and need, for
baccalaureate-prepared nurses,&#x201D; said Dr. Kathy Cruz-Uribe, provost
at CSU Monterey Bay. &#x201C;There is no four-year nursing program in the
tri-county area.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The university is collaborating with four local community
colleges &#x2013; Monterey Peninsula, Hartnell, Cabrillo and Gavilan &#x2013; to
avoid a costly duplication of classes, labs, equipment and faculty.
&#x201C;This is an historic moment in nursing education,&#x201D; said Dr. Tom
McKay, director of CSUMB&#x2019;s program. &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t just another
nursing program. This intense collaboration with community colleges
is historic in the California State University system. This may be
a model for a new way of doing nursing education.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In a typical bachelor&#x2019;s program, the curriculum focuses on the
clinical aspect of the profession rather than its public policy
implications. At CSUMB, Dr. McKay said, students will look at the
broader picture. Th ey will be educated to serve as health care
navigators, helping patients manage multiple conditions such as
hypertension and diabetes outside the hospital setting. Students
will begin the program in June and spend a calendar year in
university classes, including courses in information technology and
research methods. Then they will complete the standard two-year
community college program before returning to the university for a
fi nal semester that includes classes in public health and a
capstone or culminating project. The entire program can be
completed in 37 months.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the final semester, it will all come together for students,&#x201D;
Dr. McKay said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s when they&#x2019;ll see the global picture.&#x201D;</p>
<p>While news reports indicate that nurses have lost jobs during
the current economic downturn, Dr. McKay said there is hidden
demand.</p>
<p>&#x201C;New graduates can&#x2019;t find jobs because older nurses are working
longer,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;When the wave of retirements comes, a big demand
will become apparent. It&#x2019;s a crisis in the making.&#x201D;</p>
