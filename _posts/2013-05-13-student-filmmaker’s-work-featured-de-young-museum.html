<p>Ed Carapezza lingers over the description of places he&#x2019;s seen as
if he wished he had a&#xA0;camera instead of words.</p>
<p>He has always loved the de Young fine art&#xA0;museum in San
Francisco. Since he was a young man, he said, he&#x2019;s made pilgrimages
there &#x2013; from its pre-earthquake incarnation to its current &#x201C;copper-
sheathed modern spectacle.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So when he had a chance to work on a film for the venerable
museum&#x2019;s artist-in-residence program last fall, he was
thrilled.</p>
<p>&#x201C;To have an original work in the de Young is a dream come true,&#x201D;
Carapezza said.</p>
<p>The filmmaker, poised to complete his degree at CSUMB&#x2019;s
Teledramatic Arts &amp; Technology Department (soon to be Cinematic
Arts &amp; Technology), is set to launch a fundraising campaign for
<a href="http://sharedvisionfilms.com/" rel="nofollow">Shared
Vision</a>, the continuation of a journey he began with his
capstone project.</p>
<p>Carapezza&#x2019;s taken a circuitous route to where he is now &#x2013; he
worked in Hollywood as a grip and electrician and on the East Coast
in construction; he studied at CSUMB, left and came back. Along the
way, he watched communities finding vibrant newuses for old places.
He saw artists take hold &#x201C;of these old scrap places&#x201D; and turn them
into studios where they could work on their art. He was
captivated.</p>
<p>Now, his filmmaking is gaining traction as&#xA0;it returns to
that theme. Last fall Carapezza, 43, made the short film <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=sxIbqiLQP6Q#!" rel="nofollow">Prepping for Frescomania</a> as a companion film for
artist Javier Manrique&#x2019;s tour as artist-in residence at the de
Young. The film follows Manrique in his studio working on a fresco
paint- ing, talking about the ancient art of fresco &#x2013; from 1,200
year-old wall paintings at Teotihuacan to contemporary frescoes
dotting the Bay Area.</p>

<p>Prepping for Frescomania grew out of Shared Vision, Carapezza&#x2019;s
capstone project in 2011. It was a short film he made with a crew
of students and alumni that tells the story of life at Project
Artaud, a San Francisco artist community of which Manrique is a
member.</p>
<p>Now, Carapezza is launching a fundraising cam- paign on
Kickstarter to take Shared Vision to the next level. He wants to
document artist communi- ties around the world, beginning in
California.</p>
<p>Steven Levinson, a media professor who&#x2019;s known Carapezza for
over 10 years, said he&#x2019;s been effective at collecting a strong crew
of students and alumni around him. And Carapezza&#x2019;s commitment to
community art is unique, Levinson said, and fundamental to the
university&#x2019;s mission.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s unusual for someone to have such a real community
interest,&#x201D; Levinson said &#x201C;to already be creating projects that are
getting real distribution.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Carapezza, who works in a pharmacy mailroom to cover the bills,
has a seemingly endless supply of ideas and plans already in
action, from a skateboard company to a project that documents
touring bands playing short sets on their way through the Central
Coast.</p>
<p>Wherever Carapezza and his production company, Dangerbag
Productions, end up, he said, &#x201C;you can be sure it will be in the
border towns, on the front lines, in the cracks of the walls, in
the pushed-up crevices of sidewalks, and on the edge.&#x201D;</p>
