<p>Cal State Monterey Bay has turned 20 years old. The campus grew out of Fort Ord, a decommissioned Army base with a rich history going back to 1917. The base was a major location for basic training, reaching its heyday during the Vietnam War. More that 1.5 million men and women have served here.</p>
<p>As the university moves forward, the service of these men and women will always be remembered. Their legacy is a part of CSUMB’s identity. Today, you’ll still find pieces of Fort Ord’s military past across campus – in murals, in renovated buildings, and even in new buildings such as the Alumni &amp; Visitors Center (the lobby ceiling is made of wood recycled from demolished Army barracks).</p>
<p>We are weaving our own story into theirs. This is still a place of transformation – and will be for years to come.</p>
