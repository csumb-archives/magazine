<p>Even while Cal State Monterey Bay is in a growth mode, people on campus are nearly as excited about buildings coming down as they are about the ones going up.</p>
<p>Abandoned military buildings – decaying reminders of the campus’s Fort Ord legacy – are being removed. While many of the former military buildings have been repurposed, others are unusable because of their age, condition, cost-prohibitive abatement issues, or non-compliance with current building codes and accessibility standards. Campus officials hope the blight removal can be completed in the near future.</p>
<p>"We believe (the cost of) all of our remaining demolition will be approximately $30 million," said Katie Timmerman, senior construction/project manager for Campus Planning and Development. "What we have been discussing with the CSU Chancellor’s Offce is receiving that money in three phases, over three years."</p>
<p>She said once the funding commitment is finalized, the university will take about six months to come up with step-by-step guidelines for the remaining demolition. Removing the "hammerhead" buildings – former barracks that stand in a line on the eastern side of campus – is the top priority.</p>
<p>The CSU-funded demolition of 14 buildings on campus last summer: 13 in the Dunes area on the northwest side of campus, and one portion of a hammerhead.</p>
<p>Companies bidding on the demolition face a number of challenges. First is abatement. When the buildings went up, asbestos insulation and lead paint were the norm. Now those hazardous materials require special handling and disposal.</p>
<p>It’s also difficult for bidders to estimate demolition costs for buildings constructed at different times to a variety of standards.</p>
<p>"Some are just quick-and-dirty construction, some are built like fortresses," Timmerman said. "Going into a project, it is hard to know which is which."</p>
<p>For example, the company that demolished the Dunes buildings this summer previously had done a similar demolition of two buildings on Divarty Street, Timmerman said. The company found, however, that the Dunes buildings had been constructed to a later code, with considerably larger footings that took twice as long to uproot.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges – or perhaps because of them – the university expects the project to attract a number of qualifed bidders.</p>
