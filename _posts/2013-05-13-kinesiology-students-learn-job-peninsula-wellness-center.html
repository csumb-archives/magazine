<p>Since opening in February 2011, the Peninsula Wellness Center in
Marina has employed kinesiology students and graduates from Cal
State Monterey Bay. It&#x2019;s a natural partnership.</p>
<p>Kinesiology &#x2013; the science of human movement &#x2013; is the fourth most
popular major at CSUMB, enrolling 9 percent of students. They study
the human body and physical activity, graduating with a Bachelor of
Science degree.</p>
<p>To date, 15 CSUMB students and graduates have earned valuable
experience working at PWC, which is part of Community Hospital of
the Monterey Peninsula. Five currently are employed at the
center.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was a perfect fit, with CSUMB just down the street from our
facility and well-known as<br>
a university with a top kinesiology program,&#x201D; said PWC General
Manager Kristine Drinovsky.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Kinesiology majors have the knowledge and expertise that we
require.&#x201D;</p>
<p>CSUMB interns and alumni work as personal trainers, group
exercise instructors and exercise specialists. They perform fitness
testing, check&#xA0;blood pressure, prescribe exercise and offer
equip- ment orientations.</p>
<p>Jake Flores &#x2019;10 has worked for PWC since June 2011.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was very lucky that the Peninsula Wellness Center opened
shortly after I graduated,&#x201D; Flores said. &#x201C;I am from the area, went
to college locally and love Monterey County. It&#x2019;s a great facility
with great coworkers and great gym members.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
<p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, kinesiology
is one of the fastest-growing majors in the country. As the U.S.
population confronts aging and weight gain, personal trainers and
fitness instructors are in high demand.</p>
<p>Student Mariah Fulton works 15 hours a week interning as an
exercise specialist at PWC. She&#x2019;ll graduate this spring with her
kinesiology degree and an emphasis in exercise science.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Working at the PWC has been a wonderful experience,&#x201D; Fulton
said. &#x201C;I have learned so much from coworkers and the members.&#x201D;</p>
<h3>Wellness Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep moving. Find what you like to do, whether it&#x2019;s lifting
weights, sports or Zumba, and do it. Our bodies are made to
move.</li>
<li>Focus on flexibility and mobility. Keeping our muscles and
joints healthy is key to progression. Injuries just bring
everything to a stop.</li>
<li>Get sufficient sleep for healthy brain function and performance
throughout the day.</li>
<li>Food is fuel. Don&#x2019;t take in more energy than you need.</li>
<li>Be happy! Take care of your mental health as well as your
physical health.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x2013; Jake Flores</p>
<ul>
<li>Drink a glass of water before each meal. It will tell your body
you are full, so you don&#x2019;t overeat.</li>
<li>Half of your plate should be fruits and vegetables.</li>
<li>Reduce the amount of trans fat you eat to zero.</li>
<li>Take the stairs instead of the elevator, or walk to class
instead of driving.</li>
<li>The hardest part of working out is getting out of bed, so bring
a friend and make it fun.</li>
</ul>
