<p>They met &#x201C;almost by accident at a school dance.&#x201D; He had been in
the United States for less than a year.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I thought he was very exotic, coming from Argentina,&#x201D; said
Holly Byers Ochoa, remembering meeting her future husband more than
46 years ago. &#x201C;We hit it off so well. We had such great
conversations.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The relationship that began at Woodrow Wilson High School in
Portland, Ore., has now wound its way to California&#x2019;s Central
Coast, where Eduardo M. Ochoa is taking over leadership of Cal
State Monterey Bay with his wife Holly by his side.</p>
<p>They married while both were at Reed College and since then they
have lived and worked at a number of locations around the
country.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Living in New York City was great fun as a young married
couple, but for raising a family, California has been great. While
living in Claremont we were able to go to the beach, the big city,
the mountains, or the desert, all within an hour&#x2019;s drive,&#x201D; Ms.
Ochoa said. &#x201C;As empty-nesters, we enjoyed the Sonoma wine country,
so I guess it depends on where you are in your life journey.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For a time during the Ochoas stay in Washington, D.C., the
family, including sons Michael and Eric, all lived together in an
old Victorian home. For now, Michael, an insurance adjuster with
Travelers, and Eric, a graduate student at George Washington
University, remain in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Ms. Ochoa, who has a bachelor&#x2019;s degree from Reed and a master&#x2019;s
from City University of New York, has worked as a historian, writer
and editor. At Claremont Colleges, she was the editor of a
five-volume work of collected papers of Civil War figures Thaddeus
Stevens, Salmon P. Chase and Lucretia Mott.</p>
<p>She said that, while she will miss the museums in Washington,
she is looking forward to getting involved in the arts and history
community on the Central Coast. And she has begun to take advantage
of the natural resources that are just outside the front door of
the president&#x2019;s home on East Campus.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve enjoyed bike riding since childhood, including trail
riding. I also like to hike whenever and wherever possible. Eduardo
and I plan to ride the local beach trails next,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>She said she has been gratified by the positive reception the
Ochoas have received upon their arrival on campus.</p>
<p>She traces the roots of her husband&#x2019;s preparation for this
position back to his undergraduate liberal arts studies at Reed,
&#x201C;which ranged from physics to philosophy, with quite a lot in
between.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;To be a good college president, it helps to have a grasp of the
big picture and to be able to research and analyze problems, which
Reed equipped him to do,&#x201D; she said.</p>
