<h3>Publications</h3>
<p><strong>Dr. William D. Head</strong>, director&#xA0;of the
Undergraduate Research&#xA0;Opportunities Center and
professor&#xA0;in the Division of Science and&#xA0;Environmental
Policy, and <strong>Jessica&#xA0;Brown,</strong> assistant
director&#xA0;of undergraduate research, have&#xA0;co-authored a
chapter in a book,&#xA0;&#x201C;Undergraduate Research Offices&#xA0;and
Programs: Models and Practices,&#x201D;&#xA0;to be published next year by
the Council on Undergraduate&#xA0;Research. Their chapter is titled
&#x201C;Undergraduate Research at&#xA0;Primarily Undergraduate
Institutions.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kent Adams</strong>, chair of the Kinesiology
Department, and&#xA0;colleagues from the U.S., Australia and
Finland have been studying&#xA0;motivation among older athletes in
the World Masters Games&#xA0;and the International Golden Oldies
World Rugby Festival. One&#xA0;finding is that older adults love
fun, with socializing and getting&#xA0;fit outranking motives such
as weight loss and living longer.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rob Weisskirch</strong>, a professor in the Liberal
Studies Department,&#xA0;has studied cell phones in parent-teen
relationships. In a&#xA0;study reported online in Cyberpsychology,
Behavior, and Social&#xA0;Networking, a peer-reviewed journal, Dr.
Weisskirch found that&#xA0;the nature of the calls and who
initiates them can affect the relationship.&#xA0;Ultimately, his
study shows, the phone is a tool that may&#xA0;augment the
parent-teen relationship but doesn&#x2019;t substitute for it.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny Keller</strong>, an instructor in the Science
Illustration program,&#xA0;contributed a chapter, &#x201C;Why Sketch?,&#x201D;
and the cover illustration&#xA0;to &#x201C;Field Notes on Science and
Nature,&#x201D; published by Harvard&#xA0;University Press. It offers
practical advice that amateur naturalists&#xA0;and students can use
to document their adventures.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umi Vaughan</strong>, assistant professor of
Africana Studies, has&#xA0;written &#x201C;Carlos Aldama&#x2019;s Life in Bat&#xE1;:
Cuba, Diaspora and the&#xA0;Drum.&#x201D; The book will be published in
January by Indiana University&#xA0;Press. It traces the history of
the bat&#xE1; &#x2013; a two-headed, hourglassshaped&#xA0;drum &#x2013; from Africa to
Cuba and the United States.</p>
<h3><strong>Recognition&#xA0;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Forrest Melton, Dr. Lars Pierce, Lee Johnson and
Dr.&#xA0;Chris Lund</strong>, CSUMB senior research scientists,
have had their&#xA0;work on behalf of California growers and water
managers recognized&#xA0;as the outstanding partnership for 2011 in
the Far West&#xA0;Region of the Federal Laboratory Consortium for
Technology&#xA0;Transfer (FLC). As part of the award-winning
project, the CSUMB&#xA0;group teamed with engineers and scientists
from NASA, the California&#xA0;Department of Water Resources and
growers to develop a&#xA0;system for mapping daily irrigation
demand.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Scott Waltz</strong>, associate professor in the
Liberal Studies Department,&#xA0;was honored at the annual teaching

Monterey County.&#xA0;Dr. Waltz received the Allen Griffin Award

<p><strong>Dr. Manuel Carlos</strong>, professor emeritus in the
Division of Social,&#xA0;Behavioral and Global Studies and a
founding faculty member&#xA0;at CSUMB, was recognized by President
Felipe Calderon of&#xA0;Mexico for his environmental work in the
Puerto Vallarta region.&#xA0;Dr. Carlos is leading a successful
effort to preserve a species of&#xA0;turtle important in the
ecological cycle of the Bay of Banderas.</p>
<h3><strong>Art</strong></h3>
<p>Theater professor <strong>Will Shephard&#x2019;s</strong> historical
play, &#x201C;Coyote&#xA0;Tales,&#x201D; will have its premiere on campus Nov. 4.
