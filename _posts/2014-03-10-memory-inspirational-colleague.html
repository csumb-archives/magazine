<p>Hayashi &amp; Wayland Accounting and
Consulting has supported Cal State Monterey Bay&#x2019;s College of
Business since 2007, primarily through sponsorships of the Have A
Heart for Students event, the School of Business Showcase and
through student scholarships.</p>
<p>In 2012, the company made a $50,000 pledge to create the Hayashi
&amp; Wayland Endowed Scholarship in memory of Sunny Wong, a
partner in the firm who died in October 2010. The scholarship is to
be awarded to business majors concentrating in accounting.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sunny was an inspiration to all of us who had the honor to work
with her,&#x201D; said Mike Briley, managing partner. &#x201C;Whether you were a
partner, co-worker or client, she was well-respected in the
accounting profession and will always be missed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hayashi &amp; Wayland created the endowed scholarship both to
support higher education and to recognize Wong&#x2019;s contributions to
the accounting profession.</p>
<p>Company officials said that having a strong accounting program
nearby is a great asset to the firm and to the larger business
community. Hayashi &amp; Wayland has hired many CSUMB alumni as
full-time employees and has employed the university&#x2019;s accounting
summer students.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As the third anniversary of Sunny&#x2019;s passing approaches, she is
always in our hearts and will never be forgotten,&#x201D; said Sandra
Mason, human resources manager. &#x201C;Hayashi &amp; Wayland is proud to
honor her memory today and always.&#x201D;</p>
