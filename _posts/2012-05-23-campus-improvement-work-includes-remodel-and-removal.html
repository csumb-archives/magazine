<p>Over the summer, 70 former Army structures were taken
down&#xA0;as work continues to improve the safety and appearance of
campus,&#xA0;which is located on part of the former Fort Ord
base.</p>
<p>About 90 percent of construction debris &#x2013; including
metal,&#xA0;wood and concrete foundations &#x2013; was recycled, keeping
it out of&#xA0;landfills. And 15,000 pounds of e-waste found in the
buildings&#xA0;was recycled.</p>
<p>Some of the residence halls were repainted and
recarpeted;&#xA0;work began on a new roof and other improvements to
the&#xA0;University Center; and CSUMB took over three buildings
that&#xA0;had been occupied by Golden Gate University. One of
those&#xA0;buildings houses classrooms, one was assigned to the
Kinesiology&#xA0;Department for an anatomy and physiology lab, and
the&#xA0;third will be used for storage.</p>

<p>A Caterpillar tears into the remainder of a former
barracks&#xA0;building that was deconstructed at the corner of
Inter-Garrison Road and Seventh Avenue. The building was one
of&#xA0;70 former Army structures removed over the summer.</p>
