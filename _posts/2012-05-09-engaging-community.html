<h3>Programs, faculty and students converge to make the
university&#xA0;a leader in civic engagement &#x2013; and alumni keep it
going.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic
Engagement has heralded CSU Monterey Bay as a model for preparing
students to become engaged and socially responsible citizens. This
federal task force composed of civic and higher education leaders
has diagnosed the United States with anemic civic health, pointing
to low voter turnout, poor civic knowledge among high school and
college students, and civic apathy among the population.</p>
<p>In a report called &#x201C;A Crucible Moment: College Learning and
Democracy&#x2019;s Future,&#x201D; the group calls upon U.S. colleges and
universities to advance civic learning and democratic engagement.
They point to CSU Monterey Bay as an institution that has tackled
this challenge.</p>
<p>In January, President Dianne F. Harrison joined other leaders in
higher education, policy makers and stakeholders in Washington for
the White House Convening on Civic Learning. The purpose was to
discuss ways to weave civic learning and democratic engagement
throughout K-12 and college education.</p>
<p>Educators nationwide are eager to follow the university&#x2019;s lead
as they tackle the vexing challenge of increasing civic knowledge
and responsibility.</p>
<p class="pullquote"><a href="http://magazine2.staging.csumb.edu/news/2012/may/3/building-bridges-rope-helps-strengthen-students-math-skills" rel="nofollow">Read about Zac Walker&apos;s Capstone that incorporated
math and service learning to engage local youth.&#xA0;</a></p>
<p>At CSU Monterey Bay, education toward democratic engagement
starts with service learning, which the university requires of both
lower- and upper-division students in every major. The Service
Learning Institute coordinates this work and helps all faculty
develop courses that support civic literacy from a relevant
disciplinary perspective. Their focus is not merely on hours of
service and the completion of projects, but also on creating
discourse about justice and social responsibility across
campus.</p>
<h4>LINK TO SERVICE LEARNING</h4>
<p>&#x201C;We push them to talk about policy and get into the debate,&#x201D;
said Dr. Seth Pollack, the institute&#x2019;s director. &#x201C;Not that there is
an easy answer. But we encourage them to become a part of the
process and to act on the issues they care about.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Senior Christopher Sakamoto is one student who became engaged
through his service learning class, but wound up going above and
beyond the basic course requirements because the class ignited a
deeper passion. The Teledramatic Arts and Technology major selected
Monterey County&#x2019;s juvenile hall for his service learning placement
out of a sense of responsibility to his hometown, Salinas, and the
feeling that he could make a positive contribution. &#x201C;We
were&#xA0;dealing with kids who are considered the worst of the
worst &#x2013; murderers and attempted murderers. But take note that they
were really kids, 15 or 16 years old.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Chris and his class partner, Kayla Strasser, decided to create a
documentary that illustrates the experience of incarcerated young
men who spend over 18 hours per day alone in their cells. This
project was slated to last six weeks, but Chris wound up visiting
juvenile hall for 14 weeks, in part to complete the interviews and
also because of the positive mentoring relationships he developed
with the young convicts. &#x201C;It just felt good,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Long after the class ended, Chris is still working with
officials at juvenile hall to finish an edited version that can be
shown publicly. He hopes the resulting film will illustrate a more
faceted story about the issues facing young people in Salinas than
the public sees in news reports. His ideal audience would be middle
schoolers. &#x201C;I think showing it to that age group could have a big
impact on the choices they make,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Chris also screened a rough cut of the film as part of the
Service Learning Institute&#x2019;s &#x201C;Social Justice&#x2026;Not Just Us&#x201D; film
series. Following the screening, the audience participated in a
discussion of the criminal justice system in our nation.</p>
<p>This illustrates the way student engagement begins with the
service learning class experience, but often expands to continued
discussion at multiple levels across campus and an on-going
commitment on the student&#x2019;s part. Though Chris will graduate this
May, he is in talks with the TAT department to participate as an
instructor in the Imagine College summer outreach program,
sponsored by the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program, teaching
introductory filmmaking classes to high school students.</p>
<h4>ALUMNI CONTINUE THE WORK</h4>
<p>The civic engagement sparked through service
learning on campus and in the community leads to long-term outcomes
that manifest in CSUMB alumni &#x2013; another factor that impressed the
national task force. CSUMB graduates display an ongoing commitment
to participating in the public sphere &#x2013; whether through a lifetime
of volunteer service, a career in government or nonprofits, or
simply by participating thoughtfully and respectfully in public
dialogue around issues that affect communities on the local, state,
national and international levels.</p>
<p>Take Vincent Delgado, for an example. This 2010 graduate of the
Social and Behavioral Sciences department now works at Safe Place
in Monterey, running programs for runaway and homeless youth, and
overseeing the service placements of several current CSUMB
students.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our main strategy is to strike up positive, mentoring
relationships and try to get the youth engaged in constructive
activities that also teach them skills &#x2013; things like how to cook,
how to work in a team,&#x201D; Delgado said. &#x201C;That positive engagement
then translates into the streets.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When he transferred to CSUMB from a community college in Los
Angeles, Delgado didn&#x2019;t have a specific career path in mind. His
service learning placement at Walter Colton Middle School, where he
supported the school counselor and had his own caseload of eight
students, helped him recognize his affinity for working with
troubled youth.</p>
<p>As a friend and mentor to homeless youth, he
has worked to foster positive relationships among local business
owners, the county and the youth. One project, called National Safe
Place, engages businesses and other agencies as resources.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If a youth is in crisis after we close at 6, they can go into a
place like East Village (coffee house), sit down, have a cup of
coffee and get a snack, chill out and call our 800 hotline to
access additional services,&#x201D; Delgado said.</p>
<p>Service learners at CSU Monterey Bay have assisted with this
outreach message, providing information to businesses about Safe
Place and its mission and enlisting their support.</p>
<h4>IN SEARCH OF SOLUTIONS</h4>
<p>Much of the civic engagement at the
university involves youth outreach, but there are other examples as
well. This tax season, for instance, business students partnered
with the Internal Revenue Service and United Way of Monterey County
to provide free tax-preparation assistance to individuals and
families who earned less than $50,000 in 2011.</p>
<p>The previous year, 20 students volunteered at eight county
locations and helped taxpayers claim $1 million in refunds, said
Professor Cathy Ku, who spearheads the project on campus.</p>
<p>On another part of campus, students from the School of
Information Technology &amp; Communication Design joined other area
college and university students and software engineers to develop
mobile-device applications for businesses, government agencies and
nonprofits through an intensive coding competition called &#x201C;The
Ideas of March.&#x201D; In the end, all the &#x201C;app&#x201D; code will be posted on
the Internet so anyone can use and adapt it.</p>
<p>Such initiatives, in service learning courses and beyond, are
what make CSU Monterey Bay a model of civically inspired learning
for other universities, said President Dianne Harrison.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our students, staff and faculty engage. They ask tough
questions, think critically, discuss, reframe and seek solutions,&#x201D;
Dr. Harrison said.&#xA0;&#x201C;They bring their knowledge and experience
to bear.&#x201D;</p>
