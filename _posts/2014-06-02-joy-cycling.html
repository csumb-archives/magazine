<h3><br>
Student advocate pushes for&#xA0;&#x201C;Bike-Friendly University&#x201D;
status</h3>
<p class="intro">When Bernard Green found his father&#x2019;s old road
bike in the back of the garage, his life changed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was like
flying,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I loved feeling the wind rush by.&#x201D;</p>
<p>His dad made him a deal &#x2013; keep up biking, and he&#x2019;d buy Bernard
his own road bike. The deal stuck and before long Bernard was
cycling competitively at the LA Velodrome.</p>
<p>After a year of track racing, Bernard felt the competition was
taking away from the joy of riding. So he changed gears, became a
bicycling advocate, and focused on sharing that joy with
others.</p>
<p>The summer after his freshman year at CSUMB, Bernard returned to
his hometown of Los Angeles and took a full-time internship with LA
Bike Trains, an organization that helps new riders feel more
comfortable commuting on bikes by organizing group rides or &#x201C;bike
trains.&#x201D; The trains cover various routes through the city on
weekday mornings. The pace is easy, the atmosphere social, and new
riders find safety in numbers.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s basically a moving bike party,&#x201D; he said. As an intern, the
Human Communication major helped the organization with its website,
with fundraising, and with screening potential bike train
&#x201C;conductors.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That summer he also gained certification as an instructor with
the League of American Bicyclists. With that experience and
credential under his belt, Bernard came back to CSUMB and founded
the Monterey Bike Project.</p>
<p>Bernard describes the work of the project in three parts: First,
educating cyclists by offering traffic safety and bike maintenance
classes. Second, advocating for better cycling facilities and
bike-friendly policies on campus and in Seaside and Marina.
Finally, strengthening the cycling community through group rides
and activities that connect new cyclists to more knowledgeable and
experienced riders.</p>
<p>His goal is for CSUMB to be officially recognized by the League
of American Bicyclists as a bike-friendly campus by the time he
graduates in 2016.</p>
<p>After graduation, Bernard sees himself moving to the Pacific
Northwest and studying urban planning in graduate school.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Bernard wants to contribute to a larger movement
toward sustainability. He envisions a time when a sustainable
lifestyle will be the status quo, and people would have to go out
of their way to live unsustainably.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And the bike is one way to do that.&#x201D;</p>
