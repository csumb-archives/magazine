<p><strong>Angelica Muro</strong>, an assistant professor in the
Visual and Public Art Department, recently participated in Chico
&amp; Chang at the San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art, which
explored the interwoven and sometimes incongruous cultures of two
of California&#x2019;s largest populations, the Latino and Asian
communities.</p>
<p>In recognition of his work to promote service learning and
community-campus partnerships throughout the Monterey Bay and
Salinas Valley, <strong>Dr. Seth Pollack</strong>, director of

Richard E. Cone Award by California Campus Compact.</p>

for the Humanities for a program to train K-12 teachers from around
the country about the history of California&apos;s missions. Archaeology
professor <strong>Dr.&#xA0;Ruben Mendoza</strong> and two students
wrote the grant for NEH&apos;s &quot;Landmarks of American History and

<p>Most Californians are familiar with how struggles over water
have shaped the modern American West. <strong>Enid Baxter
Blader</strong>, chair of the Cinema Arts and Technology
Department, helped to educate New Yorkers about that history when
her video, &#x201C;The West,&#x201D; was projected onto the Manhattan Bridge
anchorage and archway.</p>

engineering in California, a history that has determined the
colonization and contemporary conditions of the western United
States.</p>

painting in the Visual and Public Art Department and a nationally
known muralist, participated in an international contemporary art
exhibition in Tbilisi, Georgia.</p>

practices and community-based methodologies at the Tbilisi State
Art Academy, and created a series of collaborative &#x201C;tire totems&#x201D;
with students and passersby in a public market. (have a photo)</p>
<p>The CSU and Sony Electronics, in partnership with Intel,
presented the Sony Electronics Faculty Award for Innovative
Instruction with Technology to <strong>Dr. Kate

Communication Design, is helping students develop more advanced
skills by &quot;flipping the classroom&quot; &#x2013; allowing students to

by practical skills application in class.&#x2028;</p>
<p><strong>Dio Mendoza</strong> and <strong>Juan
Luna-Avin</strong>, instructors in the Visual and Public Art
Department, had their own exhibition at San Jose City College&#x2019;s
Carmen Castellano Fine Arts Center.</p>

Francisco and in March, he traveled to Lima, Peru, to make a
