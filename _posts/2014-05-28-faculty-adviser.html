<h3>Why the&#xA0;Humanities Matter</h3>
<p class="small">By REN&#xC9;E CURRY</p>
<p class="intro">A former student of mine, whose husband has been
living with a brain tumor for over a decade, highly values the
science and technology that keeps her husband alive, but when asked
how she copes day-to-day in this world, she talks about catharsis
and the crucial role of the humanities:</p>
<p>&#x201C;In 1842, Ralph Waldo Emerson lost his 5-year
old son,&#x201D; my former student said. &#x201C;His poem about the loss,
&#x2018;Threnody,&#x2019; provides me a waypoint for my own struggles. Across
time, Emerson reaches out and helps me navigate through the
desolation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Another work, the &#x2018;Epic of Gilgamesh,&#x2019; comforts me when I sit
in the intensive care unit listening to my husband breathe and
hoping he will continue to breathe another day. Gilgamesh&#x2019;s
solitary vigil with Enkidu&#x2019;s body shows me that over 4,000 years
ago, someone felt what I feel today.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This experience of catharsis &#x2014; the purifying and purgation of
emotion, first described by Aristotle &#x2014; is one of the most profound
gifts of the humanities. It is real and transformative. Catharsis
heightens our understanding of the world; it redirects and improves
our ways of thinking and understanding; it enhances our ability to
reflect upon our lives and the lives of others.</p>
<p>People very much like us, and yet not like us at all, have
existed on this planet and have generously preserved and shared
literatures, histories, artifacts, languages, laws, cultural
practices, religions, and philosophies. These convey first-hand the
depths of worlds outside our own limited universe, the complex
emotions of differing beings, and the moral and ethical questions
that drive the conscience and logic of a time. The humanities
honors and preserves this material. Study of the humanities teaches
us to exercise the reflection, communication, analysis and
interpretation necessary to understand these words, artifacts and
cultural practices from a multitude of perspectives.</p>
<p>The words of Martin Luther King Jr. provide a lens into a life
worth living when he writes, &#x201C;An individual has not started living
until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individual
concerns to the broader concerns of humanity.&#x201D; The humanities offer
a diverse set of lenses for looking at the world, lenses that
enable us to develop empathy, compassion, and connection.</p>
<p>The humanities provide us with ways to frame the current real
world, as well as ways to engage with this world as valuable
citizens. Study of the humanities empowers us to apply ourselves
rigorously in this world, to work at being present and productive,
and to contribute to humanity by making meaning where there
sometimes seems to be none. The humanities ultimately provide
refuge for us in our darkest times and helps us understand what it
means to be merely, and significantly, human.
